The representatives can’t fight

  

  

They give us 10k gp per person

Glagoo and Themphet are not well-liked by some other Coinlords (12 of them)

- 1 Coinlord for each of the standard cfaurrencies in the world
- Glagoo is lord of soode west?
- Themphet is lord of coin “here” in Faerun; lowest lord
