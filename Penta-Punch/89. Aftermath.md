Inspiration: advantage on Medicine checks

## Aftermath

Meth, Lio, Rene search for Assedroh’s body while Erris, Levia, Ant recover in the cathedral

Triam is barely alive, but mutilated

Ilian Snowmantle is dead, Ant takes his place

Ant appoints Nasiri to replace him as the First Ranger

Hoid dips out, leaves Rene a book titled “Regarding Greyhawk"

Lord Jaarmath resigns as lord, headed to Chult (?) — apparently he picked it based on a dart throw

- Chult is an island peninsula south of Najara

Rene communes:

- People can’t be returned
- Abythriax still in Elsir Vale
- Unclear if Tigre can reincarnate
- Nasiri likes Nyvorlas
- Zuggtmoy can’t be removed
- Queen of the Hunt seems to be acting alone (others are not evil)
- Seems like the souls aren’t unwilling, but rather _unable_
    - Master Yu wasn’t able to come back
- Something in the Elsir Vale is blocking souls

Questions for next time:

- Is the Red Hand/Queen involved in soul-trapping?

## Attack?

We go to loot Karn and get attacked

Lady Welgaaden warps in shouting: “I will kill you, Worldsinger!” (referring to Rene)

![[Untitled 34.png|Untitled 34.png]]

She has “wings that look like thrusters”??

“I will destroy you in the name of the Worldbreaker!”

Considered a fiend

“The Liar (”Naliya”?) has blessed me, I shall not fall”

  

Immediately return to looting Karn

Crumpled note in Goblin, reminding him to return to the Fane of Melthuzac after Evereska

- Describes where the Fane is
- “We have collected enough, it is time to summon”

Hoid’s book just discusses the runes; mentions using items like human bone to amplify power

- Ivory also works

Karn’s weapon does extra (2d6) if you have >50% HP left

## Speaking to Jaarmath

Meth kicks a table out

We convince him to stay

He gives us intel: Lady Kaal’s informants have tracked the Red Hand to the Greycloak Hills

The entire castle

  

Ant departs to fight the lich; Lio promises to bring back Nyvorlas “for love”

Meth gives stone horns to all of the fallen monk students and declares “you have big horn energy”

“The Way of the FitnessGram Pacer”

  

## Curse Dreams

Flashes of a farm on a somewhat arid plot of land, 2 people standing in a doorway as their child is taken, me being hidden as the Red Wizards walk around the village

  

Rene: Parents died, maybe because they didn’t care about her?

  

## Commune Pt 2

- Red hand are collecting souls
- Queens may or may not be on the way to the Fane of Melthuzac, but they’re not on the plane
- Hram is not in Elsir Vale
- They have everything they need to summon Melthuzac

  

Immerstal thanks us for convincing Jaarmath to stay as we leave, gives us a scroll of Teleport

## Traveling

We get attacked but immediately nope out

Fuck up our search for the Fane of Melthuzac and a horned devil (?) flies right past

We come across a doorway with 3 dragon statues with gems in the eyes — the entrance
