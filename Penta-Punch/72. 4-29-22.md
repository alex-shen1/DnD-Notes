# The Bubble

We open in a bubble after last combat

Meth inherits enchanted hand wraps in old elvish

- Identify doesn’t work, casts Legend Lore instead
- “Wraps of Kamay” — wielded once by an ancient warrior

Master Meth encourages Assedroh to go out into the world — “Don’t let your dreams be dreams. Just do it.”

  

Erris sends Luna up a tree; sees an S-shaped curved river approximately north

- Sees people coming, but heading in a different way

Rene Legend Lores “All-Punch”

- "The hand learned the error of their ways in the later life, finding purpose in the blade, and power.”

## Traveling

- Start heading north, narrowly evade a search party
- Settle in a small (football-field size) patch of land with a trail going to the canyon
- Find a cave in to rest for the night
    - Meth attunes to the wrap overnight
        - Has +1 to attack/damage rolls; gain temp HP equal to full ki points every rest
        - Maybe “something else”
    - Meth gives his old bracers to Assedroh
        - Assedroh “worships” Tymora, but only because of Master Yu
- We continue down the path and see a hobgoblin on a hill
    - Wearing leather instead of armor
    - Just sneak past him
- Sleeping bugbear
