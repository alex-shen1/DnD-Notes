Session inspiration: Advantage on persuasion rolls

Rene has an intervention talk with Tyroche

- Tyroche figures out that Lio’s name isn’t Olly
- Big migration from Tyroche’s hometown (Drelan’s Ferry) to Evereska ~100 years ago
- (Human?) city called Rhest nearby and burned down, causing people to flee to Evereska
- Town named after some guy with a ferry omegalul
- He’s never met anyone from Evereska (“oldest and greatest elven city anywhere”)

Lio notices “something a little off” about proportions of Galanthrax – likely has to do with weird human form

- Parts of his body feel like skin
- Altered dragon

“If I drink the bioluminescent water, will I start glowing?" – Meth

Dead goblins in the room enemies were coming out of last session – looks like a dining room

Hidden room to the south – leads to a room with a painting covered in acidic jelly

Stone furniture, elven runes

Pool of clear substance in front of door – looks like a dead slime (acidic)

Rene got impaled by a trap 🡪 use Mage Hand as a minesweeper

Hallways become cleaner as we go down

Fight! 3 ochre jellies

- AC = 8
- Lio checks if Tyroche’s pee glows – it does not
- Investigates whether or not it’s real urine

“Heading into a sanctum”

- Blessing/prayer for Sehanine Moonbow (death/moon godess for elves)
- “To those who fell at the Gates of Challenge, we hope Sehanine guides your soul”
- Tyroche’s village had a shrine to Sehanine
- Door leads to a barrow of some sort
- “Classic Penta-Punch: desecrating graves” – Rene
- Lots of old-looking bodies lined on the walls
- Incense in a tin

Attacked by more slimes

Black lines go from the ooze – each has ~20 hp

Erris burned a 4th level spell slot just to do 5 fire damage lul

Shovel dug path

Short rested in a hut to heal – Tyroche’s bandages lul

Coffin of someone important, but name scratched out – found a paper

Scroll of Augury

Message to Hoid: “Where are you? Warn of invasion. Mostly destroyed forward party. Army has dragons and mega magical explosives. Stuck in trial. Get elves to extract us.”

Entered a tunnel above the sanctum, newly constructed – gets shorter so Meth has to duck

- “To the fallen workers who helped us construct this great monument”
- Statue of dwarf and elf hugging

Workshop of some kind

Left walls omegalul

Tight corridor to mural displaying dwarf-elf friendship with a blue sapphire

- Cooling effect, pleasant to hold, ocean breeze smell
- Air elemental summon once per week! Refill with a second level slot
- Must be attached to a weapon

Tyroche ran off after getting insulted and the party split to search for him

- Rene, Erris, Levia find a blasted tunnel to the outside
- Meth and Tigre find coffins, broken coffin

We found Tyroche and found the secret exit

Meth and Tigre find a shiny metal (unlike any other) hatch above them, it won’t move

- Dwarvish script: “Do not open”
- Meth goes through the hatch but it closes behind him
- Door with a skull on it
- “Teleportation magic works weirdly here because it’s beyond the Weave Barrier”
- Hand prints, dwarvish word for evil written
- He gets stuck in a vampire room
- Dwarven vampire – very well dressed, right eye has a “multifaceted globe” much more sinister than the Evil Medallion – the Eye of Vecna in his face

Vecna – once-human lich who ascended to godhood, betrayed by inhuman allies and had eye ripped out

Reascension requires reaquisition of the eye, which is buglike and bulging out of socket

People MAJORLY SUS of Tyroche

- Mom and Dad’s names Vrith and Welad

It’s a Major Image! Tyroche is a green dragon illusionist (Xaersoissurth)

- Manchune – guy with Bane voice who can scry
- Dark green candle, medallions fitted into capstones in dome-shaped room
- Single person killed on an altar
- Masked man with fur?
- 8 ft guy saying he promised he’d be watching west roads
- disruption in the Woldyn Gayt
- guy was scrying – problem came from desert
- they think the wizards are dumb
- they know Galanthrax is dead, have sent reinforcements
- “no one shall find out about our secret war”
- “continue looking into ghost lord of the thornwaste and the kiri kitor”
- “Evereska will fall”

Evereska has 3 queens
