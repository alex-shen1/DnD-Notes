## The Returning

Rene thinks Amaunator isn’t a real god

- Levia and Rene get into a theological conflict over if Lathander or Amaunator is the prime deity and which is the aspect
- Rene uses the stone to Legend Lore Lathander
- Information comes as a cacophony of voices
    - Lathander crusaded against the undead, including this very atropal (and silhouetted individuals)
    - “There are rules”
- Othrek and the Stonecarver greet us as we arrive at the top of the elevator shaft
    - Sus guy in shining armor (likely Jilek) watches us come back
- They’re super impressed
    - Our names are getting carved into a wall somewhere
    - Stonecarver invites us to her personal quarters in the tower
    - Master Yu and Assedroh are coming
    - Lio and Meth attempt to convince her to make pancakes and waffles
- Rene abruptly leaves

- Master Yu arrives and immediately attacks Meth lmao
    - He wants Meth to beat up Assedroh
    - Stream flows through the monastery, can be seen from one of the mountains
        - Looks like the letter S
    - Erris pulls some trickery and Meth becomes a master!!
        - Master Yu hates being a master because apprentices are annoying
    - The stone wants Rene to teach it something new every day in exchange for not forcibly possessing her — goes to (small) archives, where Archivist Thinor gives books
    - Assedroh’s “training name” is Ass-Man — Meth had a funny training name too

## Leaving the hold

Master Yu leads us...west

We encounter 2 hill giants wrestling, wearing Red Hand clothing

Without us even interacting, Yu just BODIES them

This was a scouting party — release a flare

  

We destroy it with the air elemental, but rest in a cave nearby to heal Master Yu

- White light comes in and out of Master Yu — he can physically manifest ki
- He detects something approaching from outside

Some elf with horns leaning against a tree outside

- Red armor with infernal symbology on it

- This is Abythriax!
    - Representative of the Red Hand of Doom
    - Powerful evil, fiend-ish
    - Seasoned in combat
    - Second-in-command of the Red Hand
    - Assistant to High Wrymlord Azar Khul (?)
        - Willing to describe him as an “edgy 13-year-old child”
- Most of us give fake names
    - Penta-Punch: Tomer’s Bakers
    - Erris: Hao Long
    - Tigre: Olly Coppersmith
    - Rene: Golos
    - Levia: Levia
- Attempts to bribe us with legendary magic items each
- There are many Wyrmlord
- And we’re fighting him

## The Fight

- Abythriax
    - AC > 13
- Turns out to be an illusion, disappears
- We get CLOWNED on by a huge dragon that does 98 damage to us
    - “This is a warning. Stay out of our business.”
- Yu dies, coughing up black blood
- Stumble across a patrol that also owns us
- Yu refuses to return
