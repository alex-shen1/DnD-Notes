We get **Drillmaster’s Inspiration** — add 1 to all damage rolls

Nali runs away as soon as she sees Hoid

After 2 skill challenge successes, Erris + Rene roll a 3, 2, and then 1

Lio rolls a 1 for how to getting us out

  

Tunnels aren’t exactly sewers; a lot of abandoned buildings

We find a “gaping hole” down, 30 ft in diameter and a Light-ed pebble drops out of sight

More than 1000 ft down

  

We hear some kind of sperm-whale-esque sound; Levia attempts to replicate it

Quest! But Rene vetoes doing it lmao

  

We end up doing the quest…

Shaft widens up into a broader underground roof

We make it to the bottom

Coin of delving and light rock are gone, there are bones

  

We hear a childlike voice in our heads: “Welcome visitors! How wonderful! It’s been so long since we’ve had friends”

Water is “extremely cloudy”

Column Meth ran down lights up from Rene’s light spell; illuminates other columns

Columns not magical; just highly reflective geodes

Huge underground lake only slightly smaller than Neverwinter

Divine Sense detects one dead fiend

They force a WIS save from us; invoke Rima → they can read our minds

  

Erris does 160 damage in one turn thanks to dual Disintegrate

Lio uses Sunbeam only to hear “No! Don’t wake up the Great One!”

We wake up the Great One.

Meth stun POG

It can “mass enslave”

Erris gets diseased, but short rest + Lio Heal = ez

  

We find a nice greatsword
