Inspiration: one dice roll across the entire party

## Tigre comes back from his dreamscape

- Vulmer wasn’t much help
- Xhram was a good guy, we need to go see Innil’s hideout

## We investigate the Weave Barrier Key in Starshatter’s tower

- Note: the Keys are the obelisk things; the “keys” we’ve been referring to are different
- Tower seems completely undamaged
- Lion Guard comes up to us

## Searching the Hideout

- We return to Hook, Line and Slither to enter the sewers — takes us 20 minutes
    - Door is locked, we have to find another way to the sewers
- Erris is traumatized from Rima’s loss and takes 30 minutes to find a manhole
- We find the entrance again — feels like wood
    - It’s actually made out of wood, which we discover as Meth punches a hole in it
    - Then he rips it clean off the hinge
- Meth kicks down a door, smell of mold
    - Entire room is just garbage

## Tigre and Levia find a study and investigate

- Eventually party congregates
- We get some Fauna Guard masks
- Mostly irrelevant stuff; Erris finds some books
- Rene opens up a secret passageway to a sketchy room
    - 3 dragon heads with slight differences
        - One has crystal-shard horns — blue
        - One has reindeer horns — red
        - One is small — yellow
    - None of the dragons resemble real dragons
    - Appears to be a 3-headed dragon; kind of a shrine honoring the creature
    - Erris finds a broken +1 longbow
        - “swift death to those who have wronged me” — target becomes sworn enemy
        - gives advantage to sworn enemy, nullifies cover, long range
        - Extra 3d6 bonus
        - Disadvantage on all other attacks
        - Seems familiar to Tigre
- Transmutation magic found on a bowl in the middle of the room
    - Tigre cuts himself to pour his own blood into the bowl
    - Blood becomes turquoise in color (which happened in his vision?)
    - Tigre harvests roughly a shot’s worth of the liquid
    - Dragon eyes are faintly glowing now (see above for colors)
- Meth dumps his entire waterskin into the bowl
    - Also generates the turquoise liquid
    - Erris and Levia also use theirs
    - Dragon eyes are now glowing brightly

## Drinking the liquid

- Tigre goes first
    - Goes down very cold, but nothing really happens
- Levia also drinks it, nothing happens
- Meet up with Hoid and Golos, who are staying in the city
    - Leave some of the liquid with Hoid to investigate

## Leaving the City

- We leave heading south to chase after the attackers
- Run into a cart of refugees fleeing the city
- Tree branch has been seared off
    - Just a “disturbed area”; probably just portaled away
- We reach the south end of the Northdark Moor
    - Barren trees (due to winter)
    - Huge wetland
    - “Tigre is moonwalking”

## Attacked by Lizardfolk

- AC $\leq$﻿ 15
- They speak Draconic
- The lizardfolk think that the air elemental and Levia are air/fire gods

## Camp for the Night

- Tigre calls lightning to intimidate the local lol
- Dragon flies overhead (tiny!)

## Continuing the Journey

- Bird up and fly across the Northdark Moor
- Rene sees lots of red tents — might be the army
- We find a months-old smashed up wagon, rocks have fallen on it
    - We hide in the wagon as 5-6 hill giants walk over the cliff
    - Wearing loincloths with the emblem of the Red Hand
    - “Do you smell something? Yeah, your ass!”
    - Hide for 30 minutes, they eventually leave
- We later find the old remains of a giant king
    
    - Ambushed by Eh Zu!
    
    ![[Untitled 18.png|Untitled 18.png]]
    
    - Eh Zu knows Meth!?
- Mage Slayer AC $\geq$﻿ 17
- Eh Zu AC $\geq$﻿ 14; $<$﻿ 22
- HUGE BANISHMENT
- After being killed, Eh Zu mutates and regains full HP
    - Levia kills him
    - Eh Zu bullied Meth??

## Resting after the fight

- We rest inside the giant’s skull
- Giants come looking after we win the fight, don’t find us
    - “The Drake said they couldn’t be far”
- Hear wings flapping
    - Tiny red dragon flying across the sky
- Loot from Eh Zu:
    - Note describing Rene (under alias “Hao Long”)
    - Note from “H” suggesting party has a druid and a monk
    - We think he’s an agent of the Zhentarim
    - They know there are 5 of us
    - Continue research on “Ritual of Ascension”
- We level up!

## Continuing the Search

- Meth notices a “puff of white” coming from another mountain
- We see this:

- Dwarven clan hold, appears to be active
- Rene and Lio have a SUS conversation
    - Where get your degree
    - nice
    - evil right

## Meeting the dwarves

- We descend
    - Front (leader?) is wearing armor covering face/beard
    - Clean-shaven younger dwarf comes forward
- “Welcome to Hammerfist”
    - They don’t like the Red Hand
- “Weird old pervy monks” nearby
- Craftsmanship reminds us of Evereska
- Must demonstrate trade skill
