We kill Vulmer in the dream

Lio/Tigre can now shift at will each sunrise

## Morning

- Immerstal has accepted Rima as an apprentice, she mentioned the Mindbender
    - She’s taking Planar Magic 101
- Nyvorlas is back! But as a human
    - Rolled 18 for dick size
    - Can still transform into an owlbear
    - Tigre gives him the flamingo shirt
- Lady Kaal told us to go to the Fishery; thieves guild helped Mindbender build a fortress there
    
    - Hideout hidden under tavern (owned by aarakocra)
    - Mindbender captured Rat Man (”his rival”), seems to be mind-controlling other people

    He kills Rat Man!!
    
      
    

Mega counterspell + dispel magic

Pulls off a Banish on Lio, Dominate Person on Meth

He triggers a poison gas room, but we beast on him

He claims to have information, we think he’s Halar Starshatter gone mad

Lio dispels the magic of his extra hands and they fall off; we cut off his other hands to block spells

“I’m the one who will free man from the chains of elves”

Your rightful lord

  

Hands armor: AC = 10 + DEX + CON but disadvantage on charisma checks

The gems can’t be identified

  

Halar was investigating the queens; figured out Queens were bad and TriKlasthe could fly; wanted to search the asylum

5/5 designated PP-DAY

We’re given connected townhouses at the center of “Old Talar”

  

Erris is staying in Talar, studying under Immerstal w/ Rima

Lio _really_ wants to look for Tomer? Meth joining him after teaching the president of the monks the Mantis Stance

Rene is taking Levia to Neverwinter, checking on “Rumbal”? (but procced insight)

  

### Post-Credits

- Azarr Kul wakes up on a beach, has no idea where he is
- Grey-cloaked, unarmed people watching a sermon

    - Firbolg emerges. stands next to a throne
    - Addresses others as delegates, claims of unity
    - “Youngest governor in the history of Dorsk” → “Dreiden”?
    
    ![[Untitled 2 13.png|Untitled 2 13.png]]
    
    - That’s a mask, not his face
    - “Dreiden” is a title honoring a deposed lord? “Nation’s father”
    - “Era of moral virtue, dignity”; elimination of debauchery
    - tl;dr Make Dorsk Great again
    - Grieving son → declare “Outriders” and their leaders enemies of the state
        - Not a preplanned statement
        - Damage the unity of the republic?
    - “Father” died on the floor, allegedly murdered
    - Strongarms the delegates into compliance
- Floating tower far above the world, rainbow fog

    - Some council watching a ping on a screen: **Contact**
    - “It seems another has been found. Elder Brain, would you do the honors?”
    - “Let’s find a new Worldsinger”
