- Naliya is suspicious to speak with Rene about their similarities “in this company”
    - Notes that Rene’s name isn’t really Rene
    - Allows Hoid to stay but wants the rest of us to leave
    - “Draconic vibes”
    - Suspicious of Meth
- Meth reads the note he found off their leader
    - “Slight mistake. Look for one with draconic features, not one without. Something wrong, for some reason tracking both”
    - Also looted **Paralyzing Field Orbs**, Spell Bouncing Shield, Gargeras’ Sword
- Hoid uses Charm Person and she becomes a lot friendlier lol
    - She’s from Fol, her world’s equivalent of Faerun
    - Unsure where the bad guys are from, but they’re “Warpknights”
        - One guy (Gargeras) was “the Worldbreaker”
    - She’s chairwoman of “Circle of Seven”, basically the Illuminati
        - We’ve heard of the “Circle of Twelve” in our world
        - They said the “Worldbreaker is coming”
        - She was targeted; other members of the Circle except her have died
    - She knows a bit of “calligraphy” i.e. Runes of Grehik
    - She seems heartbroken to see Meth → used friend named Might died fighting the Goldhand Kobolds
        - The entire rest of her party from the other world died
            - Other Erris was a fighter
        - She attempted to resurrect Might with a Rune
        - Goldhand Kobolds were led by Vulmer; Innil was a member of her party
- We get suggested to go to Hoid’s vault on the other side of the world; may contain notes on how to block Rune tracking
    - Golos is in “the Brotherlands” — land of Ceudwest
- Land druids around his vault left because of some red dragon called Emberspeak
    - Not much magic, but “some defenses”

    - Avoid town for a while
    
      
    
- Some shady folks rush us as we head out, but we go through the tree portal before we can do anything
    - Superfan kids waiting for us
    - Erris dips out to visit Rima
    - Hoid gets sent to the couch lmao
- Party identifies all the objects while Erris is gone
    - They had a caravan east of town, showed up asking for me specifically
    - Rima and Erris “audiobook and chill” → boring history
- Levia and Meth get fake married to commit bank fraud
    - Travel deals for accountholders (”Coinlord’s Club”)
    - They come back
- Regroup at Immerstal’s; these people smash through the door
