Looted corrupted salesman

- Found a small fireproof pouch
- Rahsta – currency of Thay
- 20 pieces (“black gold”) worth 5 gold each (+100 gold)

Golos finds some “weirdly glowing, heavy” coins

Who do you sell to?

- Black markets of the Zhentarim
- Many others who buy – hobgoblins,

Intimidation failed, Erris has a scar on his nose now lmao

Lio jumped in, turned into a swarm of spiders

Local buyer close by (dragonborn bugbear Azar-kul)

- Buys it for his fortress
- 10-15 at a time, bought twice
- He finds out where the sellers are via the “black network” (Zhentarim)
- Near the Greycloak hills
- In the desert, ruins of a floating sky city (“black spires” in the desert)

Renee finds 7 coins of delving

“Shadowy wall” coming in from east – it’s a sandstorm

- We left the medallion chest outside during the storm lmao

“Small metal needle” inside his trouser – poisoned

Thug’s name is Phil

Box got knocked over – medallion got knocked out

Radiant damage works on it (<20 HP)

Box empty

Another sandstorm came along, RIP Phil – died for an empty box

We spot a young elvish man as we leave the desert walking south along the desert border

Seemed to be chased “Red Hand” – army, destroyed “Drelan’s Ferry” to the north

Passage to Evereska (“last bastion of the elves this side of the world”) via the “Woldyn Gayt”

Name: Tyroche Felderleaf

~20-30 years old (_very_ young for an elf)

Looking for in a hidden cave entrance in wormwood – hidden with non-native flora

“Elsir Vale” – Evereska is merely a small city

Rene finds a tropical bush

Monstrous footprints have entered recently

Room- floor chipped away at until flat, stone block with hand print painted into the surface in red oil.

Rene fails the worthiness, we have to do the trial

SUPER BIG DUNGEON

- 15 ft ceilings, painted black to create the feeling of void
- Elvish across the walls in cracked red oil paint, just adages
- Pitch black unless otherwise stated

Orbs with green light

Hobgoblins wearing samurai

“Hand of (???)”

“Galanthrax”

Don’t let them gang up

Vampiric mist AC <14, vulnerable to radiant damage

Wraith AC = 13

Tyroche’s hometown (Drellin’s Ferry) was a mix of goblins and elves, established centuries ago

Not the “Black Knife clan”

Pan out at the end of the session

Vraathkeep – large medieval fortress

A human captain defeated by a goblin leader

“The sun will set for the Elsir Vale”
