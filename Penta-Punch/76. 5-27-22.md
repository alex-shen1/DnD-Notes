### Post-credits

Lio and Innil tumble out of the portal in a dark cave

Lio special wild shapes and attacks him

Interrogating Innil

- He says they’re trying to bring back Melthuzac before Lio kills him

The cave is Innil’s base

4 statues, one is larger than the other

- One is of Lio with a mustache
- Other is Hram with eyes slashed out
- Last ones are Innil praying to a “blackened figure” that looks like the Thinker with amber eyes + horns (statue of Asmodeus)

No exits

Mrinaal might need a new character o.O

  

### Post-post credits: Vulmer allows Lio more access to his memories

Celeria Starsinger — former leader of Tiri Kitor before the problems

- She heard a scuffle between drow and elf, elf was killed
- Drow reported that Rhest fell without any aid; seemed like elf attempted to prevent news to queen
- Tri-Queens questioned for lack of accountability, Tiri Kitor left (1000)
    - But Celeria got assassinated, leading to riots + Great Exodus

Tiri Kitor, former bodyguards of Evereska, split into 2 more factions after the civil war ended

- One led by Hram, who wanted to hold the queens accountable for destruction and Celeria’s death
- Ilian Snowmantle — wanted to preserve her legacy and rebuild separately from Evereska

So the civil war was actually between _3_ factions — the city and these groups

- Hram’s army was great, but his brothers vanished and so did he
- Hram discovered that his brothers (”the Cabal”) were conspiring with the Queen of the Hunt to help the colossals
    - Unclear how he actually figured it out
    - Engineered assassination of Celeria, assassination of Rhest, and all the destruction to get a piece of the Fang of Melthuzac
    - Melthuzac is a bastard of Tiamat; considered a “colossal”
        - Entire life has spent trying to destroy the world
    - So Hram actually killed them — burned Innil in the plains of Evereska and poisoned Vulmer, leaving him to die in the desert
