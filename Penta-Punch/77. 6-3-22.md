## Communication

- Dream/Sending fail, Legend Lore reports that plane creators can deny magic from entering/leaving the plane
- The Way Opener (dude from the Deep Ethereal) and Hoid might have knowledge on how to breach this “quarantine”
- Hoid would tell us that it can’t be a realm of dread (their owners aren’t powerful enough; you’d essentially need a god)

## Tigre Alone

Place is “Cania Hideout”? Which in _Dwarfey’s Inferno_ is the 8th level of Hell

Communes with Amaunator, told to search for throne of Mephisto

Meditates (as Tigre), summons both Lio and Vulmer into the real world, but they’re incorporeal → dismisses both of them after Vulmer refuses to cooperate

Transforms into snake and attempts to leave the chamber through an underwater passage

Leaves onto an ice sheet — SUPER COLD

We’re playing devils fighting for 60 days against the Lord of Cania, Mephistopheles

- Betrayed his son, Hutijin
- We’re his most trusted lieutenants and were with him in this orchard as demons attack
- There were 300 and now it’s just us
- Squad + some random bat

Ice Devil and Orthon are Hutijin’s childen!?

  

Consumption of Seddham (the blue liquid) prevents you from being resurrected

- Slowly splits soul into pieces, will latch onto important items

  

Only a mortal can truly kill an archfiend (power given by celestials)

Hutijin started an insurrection because he’s as powerful as Mephistopheles

Mephisto is in his tower built in a glacier — Mephistar, the Ice Citadel

  

I’m playing Minoth (the Arcanaloth)

Patrick is playing a dumb Orthon; given name Arcanaloth

Ethan playing Ice Devil who wants to be called Hutijin Jr. — immediately explodes, then he conjures a new one, who calls himself Jimothy

  

Tigre loses Lio, sends him on missions for 5 days before being summoned

  

Sneak into throne room disguised as lesser demons, Arcanoloth, Jimothy, and Arcanaloth fight his soldiers while Tigre + Hutijin attack Mephistopheles

  

We warp to Mephistopheles’ place (bottom city as tall as Evereska)

Minoth goes down like a bitch

Turns out Tigre just had to scratch Mephisto with the sword and that was it lol

Arcanaloth is used to trick Tigre into owing a life debt
