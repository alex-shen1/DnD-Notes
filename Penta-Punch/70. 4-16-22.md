# Performing for the Dwarves

- Erris sparkles
- Lio turns into a bear
- Meth uses mason’s proficiency to compress a ROCK into a snowman
    - “He should meet Stonecarver!”
- Levia begins to recall a story from her homeland and rolls a nat 20
    - The dwarves have never heard of the ocean
    - Instead of stories, she simply tells them basic geography LOL
- Everybody is rolling CRAZY tonight (3 consecutive 20s!!)

# Entering the Hold

- Leader introduces himself as Othrek Hammerfist of the Hammerfist Clan
- As they let us in, we descend on a huge mechanical elevator

![[Untitled 19.png|Untitled 19.png]]

- Seems like the entire mountain has been hollowed out for the Hammerfist clan

## Chatting with Othrek

- Othrek tells us to talk to the Stonecarver (their leader)
    - Othrek is not old/skillful enough to become leader
    - Leader selected by craftsmanship “Manilus Unuvsig” (spelling definitely wrong)
    - He is 40, family members have lived 300+ years but he expects to live less than half that
- They were involved in the invasion somehow
    - It was a tiefling warlord 2000 years ago?
- He leaves and returns with some food
- They don’t know where the Monastery of the Sundered Chain is
    - Wandering monks
- Dwarven society tends to flip between patriarchal/matriarchal depending on who the leader is
- Othrek takes us to the Stonecarver

## Meeting the Stonecarver

- Old dwarven women, short hair chiseling a hammer sculpture
    - She asks us if we’ve met Jilek?
    - Othrek asks her to talk to Jilek, she shoots it down
        - They’re doing “plan C”
    - She doesn’t really care about us; cares about her own people
- Hill giants are kinda sus
- Considers Evereska backstabbing traitors — not fond of letting the city of Rhest burn
    - Her husband died
- She took the Galanthrax scale ☹️
- Some giant door deep underground that’s been opened
- Axemaster Jilek — leader of the Shining Axes (strike force that went missing)
    - Formerly leader as greatest craftsman, lessened his craft to fight more
    - Not on great terms with the Stonecarver

  

# Descending

- Spellcasting sigils on the floor
    - More than 100,000 years old
    - Words in Abyssal/Primordial/Celestial — words scrawled as the writer died
        - “Do not open. Do not open. Do not enter.”
    - Anyone who steps into the door cannot leave before a certain (vague) criteria is met
        - Figure out that it destroys whatever’s imprisoned
        - Summoned things will not come through
        - Teleportation attempts will not work
- WTF
