Mrinaal did recap

Inspiration: any of us can reroll 1 Perception check

  

Second event begins tomorrow, hint is “defend VIP”

Opponents are **Nirogg’s Bane** → **Nirogg** is a fiendish name, so they might be divine?

Rene offers to give Bigzo 3 questions (via Commune lmao):

- “Is that bald-headed guy really strong?” → Yes
- “Is the old guy a monk?” → Yes
- “Black-haired half elf — are they stealthy?” → Yes

Bigzo trades it for this information about Nirogg’s Bane:

- They killed a Pit Fiend called Nirogg
- Met in a bodybuilding competition

  

Rene Communes about Nirogg’s Bane

- Is one of us going to be the VIP? → No
- Are there 2 or more paladins? → No
- Are there 2 or more barbarians? → Yes

  

  

We walk out on the colosseum to see 15-20k people in the stands

Gnome introduces the event! Custom rules:

- **Defend**- action: Roll dex- becomes dummy ac till start of your next turn or till you move further than arm length from the dummy
- **Tank**- reaction: take half the damage away from the dummy, but you take the full amount
- **Move**- bonus action: spend half of you movement to escort the VIP. All opportunity attacks caused by this movement target you.

- We get challenged to an arm-wrestling competition; loser has to throw a round
    - Penta-Punch largely uninterested lol
- In the middle, a summoned (3 story tall!) stone golem interrupts the round

- Damas Dawn destroys Randall and the Stags
- Ball Crushers (serious faces) vs. Galaxy Whisperers (magic item guys), who win
- One Punch vs. Bigzo’s Machine Gang!!
    - They destroy the stone golem in one hit!
    - One Punch beats Bigzo in one punch 😟
- Closnar shoots their own member (Vrarlos) and puts him to sleep as an apology
    - They forfeit???
    - They apologize to Meth, Vrarlos “hasn’t been the same” since they fought the pit fiend
    - They have an “antidote” → Meth: “I don’t do drugs”

  

The healers have not shown up yet (**sus**)

We tell a nurse that we’re “master healers” to get access to the medbay lmao

Erris double Heals Bigzo and Klonk, massive overheal lmao

Levia removes the curse on Vrarlos

### Other participants

Metal Rose vs. **Lightning Veil**

Sapphire Dancers vs. **Sacred Demons**

Well Lovers vs. **Fellowship of the Duck** (noticeably powerful)

**Twin Hearts** (generic party but look like they’re holding back) vs. Tortles of War

**Pirates of Morkhulmber** vs. The Black Company

Indigo Wyvern Circle vs. **Collateral Damage** (wizards who only know fireball)

**Swan Song** gets a bye because Hween vanished

**Order of Dragonsfell** (excessively chivalrous German knights) vs. Way of the Flagon (drunk monks)

  

Healers were supposed to come from (Luskan?) from up north

Normal healers are at Icewind Dale (beyond the Spine of the World, northernmost area in the world) with the war effort

  

Sy comes in and threatens us

  

Erris, Lio, Levia, Meth go to a bar while Rene rests from communing like 300 times

Go to a room with a beer cup as a handle, but it’s completely empty lol

Meth asks it a question about the north road and completely undecipherable

tl;dr High Road is unsafe, costs 50 gp to hire an escort to Luskan normally, but inflation to 100 gp
