Session opens with us returning to the Fallen Tower

Rather restful for everyone except Rene

Wakes up in same burning house as always, but this time meets this guy

![[Untitled 39.png|Untitled 39.png]]

Person is the **Amethyst Dragon Avatar**

Name is Nali; is a sorcerer

## Interruption

Loud bang wakes everyone up

Some kind of problem in the Protector’s Enclave

Erris and Meth go right back to bed lmao

  

Rene and Lio Commune instead of resting; Levia is already good

Some stuff about Hween (?) idk

## In the Morning

A “slight tragedy” has occurred, the Kolijez is going to accommodate us

Fuel explosion at the Iron Flagon (place has some significance to OG PP)

With 15 minutes left before the deadline for check-in, Rene Communes while we go ahead

The Iron Flagon incident was a genuine accident

Contestants were injured/killed

Rene is 1 minute late because Bolt is slow, none of the organizers notice

In the meantime:

They announced that all Hween members are assumed dead, One Punch has suffered severe injuries

Teams One and Punch are being recombined into One Punch

Sy, Bang, Charanko (?), Sonic, Garo

Some proceeds from the tournament will go to gravestones for Hween

Apparently Hween and One Punch the only group with casualties

We roll 23, in a waiting room with **Bigzo’s Machine Gang** and the **Sapphire Dancers**

Bigzo: short human teenager with a drill on his head, has a kobold friend, iron giant, self-titled “The Drillmaster”

Klonk the kobold

  

**Big Wand Society** goes first

  

## The Passway

Ottir (?), another organizer, introduces the first event: The Passway

Old sewers have been redesigned into a maze

Exit through doors marked “Earth and Heaven”

Top 32 teams pass to next event

  

Erris attempts to simply _talk_ to the Sapphire Dancers and is immediately sabotaged by the team, they get creeped out and leave

Bigzo’s Machine Gang finishes in 45 minutes; the people are sus but the machines are susser

  

We are given 1 minute to start; entrance has 2 doors with the word Knock on them

  

Erris tells it a knock knock joke, wins with Joe Mama

Lion with human face and wings (sphinx?)

Statue may be able to come to life (made by Lucasso)

  

Some of the party has cognitive dissonance from going right

  

Illusion wall

Cobwebs on the walls

Door with metal grasping hands on the door

The door has “Earth and Heaven” on it; enchanted with transmutation, evocation

  

Lay on Hands makes Heaven disappear

What doesn’t work: fire, bludgeoning, necrotic

Putting dirt into the hand does LOL

  

We did it in 27 mins! Top 3

Moolish Fortals were slightly faster

## Exit

We return to the waiting room, Bigzo has been scorched

5 dragon-sized humans

  

Moolish Fortals has Glauss, Druidal (one of them is a warlock), displacer beast, Lord Malatar. one unknown

Souls of Splehit

The robots are powered by human souls yikes

2 more days pass; we are now on the 9th of Hammer

## Next Stage

Next stage is 8am tomorrow morning

Second event is “Defend the VIP”

  

Lio notices Hween operative (?)

We drop down a manhole following them, it magically seals after we drop

Nali introduces themselves, says we need to talk

Hoid opens up from the top with popcorn
