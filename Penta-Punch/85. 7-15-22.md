## Returning to Talar

Jaarmath’s keep has more guards now

Civilians have been ordered to evacuate (14,000 sent), city is under lockdown

- Random guard challenges us to a sparring match while we wait
    - Erris bets 20 gp on Levia at 2:1 odds for Ant
        - She wins with pocket sand lmao
        - She kicks a guard right into Lord Jaarmath as he comes out
- Jaarmath seems exhausted
- Ornamental weapons have been taken down, unused
- Lizardfolk have arrived, war council meeting today
    - More were supposed to show up, but they were ambushed in the Northdark Moor
    - 500 are here!
- The Shining Axes (200) are here
- Tiri Kitor are on their way?
- 26 monks + Assedroh are all here wearing masks (to disguise that they’re goblins lmao)
- Located in the north of the city
- Siegfried will get 200 soldiers

We tell him about the shit happening in Evereska and he starts flipping out

Siegfried knows the plane of Broth lol

They talk for a while about it (Broth is place some oozes are from)

We rest in Immerstal’s tower

Pink fuzz growing behind his Ant’s lymph nodes

## The War Council

- No one represents the lizardfolk at the council
    - Looks like Speaker Rolo didn’t make it 😟
    - We get a “**Speaker Thops**(??)”
- **Tredora Goldenbrow** wants to retreat to Evereska
    - Only 5 clerics are left!?
    - **Jilek** vehemently against this, wants to defend “his father’s homeland”
    - **Triam** vouches for his mother and other residents
        - Argues that it’s still safer
- Speaker Thops wants to make peace with the other races
- Ulverth wants to send an army to the plains
    
    - Man the walls
    - Siege for “at least a week”
    
      
    

We’re gonna get in there with Siegfried’s

  

- Immerstal, Goldenbrow, Ulverth, Jaarmath, Lady Kaal, Speaker Thops, Jilek, party member

  

Siegfried discovers Ant’s treachery while sneaking into Rene + Erris’ room

“Zuggtmoy forgive me for my sins”

Ant attempts to convince Siegfried to turn against Urikel Zarel

“Who are you to judge me in place of Zuggtmoy? Only she can-” _rolls a 15_

Siegfried will attempt to kill Ant, but we stop him with Death Ward and glaive

Zuggtmoy approves of Ant!?
