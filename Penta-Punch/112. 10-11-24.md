Teleport into (one of) "Mire's Grove"
- Near Chionthar/Baldur's Gate
We're still being tracked, will forget this place when we leave
"The Mire" is some god, this is an avatar
Nature's sacred places

He asks for "things that grow" as payment, someone gives him seeds
Party argues with Nali about it

Mentions abandoned Lathander temple overrun by cultists; Levia agrees to go check it out
- Vine with purple flowers to go to the temple
"Odious presence" arrives, we wait it out, it leaves
"The Cloakwood can be a dangerous place"

Everyone forgets except Levia

## The Temple
Run into a tiger (Toffee), half-orc holding a blade (Saadri), dwarf with a vial (Frid Iwea), short old human with hair (Lohann Jeibert)
- Gnolls doing a ritual, gathering stockpiles of food

Erris aerial recon
- See "skeletal hyenas" pulling bones from corpses, laying them out on a rug
- ![[Pasted image 20241011220346.png]]
- "Actual gnolls" eating a body![[Pasted image 20241011220528.png]]

Meth pretends to be lost, they immediately sound the horn
- "The prophesized creature has appeared?"

Mega fight
EZ NUKES
Gnoll leader summons some entity that kills him
- Some entity holding a sword and green whip
- "Leader of legions of Yeonoghu"

EZ BANISH


## Amaunator
Levia cleans the temple and attempts to reach Amaunator
HE ARRIVES
![[Pasted image 20241011234054.png]]
Warplady Levia has a weapon that can kill Amaunator
- Can kill Amaunator through Levia…?
- Boon given to her specifically to "kill the sun"
Reason why alt-Levia is mad:
- "All that are born of the Sunwell are spirits taken from fallen battlefields"
- I guess she's mad that she didn't die?


Temple we're looking for is under the Paragon's house in Draconia
Paragon may be targeted by assassination
Paragon is apparently grieving something

Letza offers her object to teleport – amulet of Bahamut
- From her hometown, so EZ
- Can't use the amulet because it's too long
- Instead offers a stone toothpick
