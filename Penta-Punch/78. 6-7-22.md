## Aftermath

- Resting up after the fight
- Attempt to contact Lio; no response
- Rene says Levia is “kinda sus”

  

- The weird box/chain thing from the wyrmlord’s lair is a phylactery for a druid lich?

- Belongs to **Urikel Zarl** — Tiefling warlord/emperor who died in the Thornwaste 2000 years ago
- **Speaker Rolo** — lizardfolk guy (leader?), near the eggs
    - Eggs are more brittle than they should be
    - Eggs are inscribed with Infernal runes saying “growth” and “supplicant”
    - Talisman is using the Infernal words to modify the eggs
    - Speaker Rolo recognizes the creature that flew out as an Abishai
    - Gain power in exchange for soul
    - The opposite of those words reminds you of Regiaryx
        - Either his power was sapped for them, or writing those words results in him
    - Pledges that the 18 tribes will fight against the Red Hand
- After a long deliberation, we decide to destroy the eggs
- Dispel Magic dissolves the egg all over Meth, even cleaning it can’t make the scent go away

  

Erris goes diving

First time: see nothing

Clock:

    - Submerged room (copy of other room)
    - Piled high to ceiling — wall of MONEY
    - Set of pipes

## Elves Approach

- Lizardfolk + hostages preparing for combat, only to find Mrinaal’s new character!

![[Untitled 1 16.png|Untitled 1 16.png]]

- Southern accent, heard of us from apprentices Nyvorlas and Nasiri
    - Other guy: Dane (”madder than a stump in a swamp”) and Peanut Butter (?)
        - Archer lady Elodeer (?)
    - First Ranger of the Tiri Kitor
- Dude is completely insane lol
- Army 5,000 strong going down Witchweald River
    - 18 tribes — 500 per tribe, but realistically probably ~400
        - “Spartan culture”
        - Only roughly 15 are still in fighting shape
- Snowmantle (and Ant) doesn’t want to help Evereska

## Military Planning

- We have 8 days to reach Nimon’s Gap to stop the invading army (currently at Terelton)
    - Nimon’s Gap is built on the tip of two large plateaus
    - Sabotage the bridge
- Nyvorlas’ dad and a search party went missing in the Greycloak Hills
    - Second, Third, and Fourth Rangers were lost
    - Witchweald may be haunted
- Cities
    - Talar: breadbasket of Elsir Vale; VERY strategically valuable
    - Population: 4-5 thousand
    - Nimon’s Gap — population ~500
    - Evereska has 14-15 thousand
- We have ~2 weeks + whatever time buying to rally forces
    - _Note: week = 7 days in notes, but 10 in-universe_
    - Speaker Rolo pledges his own brood and 3-4 other tribes to the cause
    - Coopted Red Hand guys
        - Midterm is the hill giants; final is the Red Hand
    - Dwarves?
    - Elves
    - Settlement defenders
- Rene messages them
    - Assedroh trained them well — eliminated the hill giants
    - Shining Axes on the way! 200-300 elite dwarves
- We finally end up reading Saarvith’s notes — was in contact with:
    - **Azarr Kul the High Wyrmlord**
        - To: Old message, questioning whether or not to trust necromancer Ghostlord
            - Knows they stole some lich’s phylactery; questioning Ghostlord’s utility for taking Talar/Evereska
            - Frustrated with Ulwai waiting with the Ghostlord instead of joining army
            - Stolen phylactery guarantees the Ghostlord’s compliance
                - If Lich could regain phylactery, he would withdraw from the hjorde
    - General Kharn
        - To: Sent first wave of “precious greens” to him, dated 25th (today is the 28th)
        - From: Applauds Saarvith for thoughts on blockades (?)
    - Koth
        - From: Message regarding phylactery
            - Take great care with the enclosed phylactery.
            - Phylactery belongs to Ghostlord and would be mad if he found out given to Saarvith
            - “Keep hidden until Talar is taken; should it fall into hands of someone who can return to owner, consequences can be dire”
    - Ulwai Stormcaller

## Military Count

- 4-5 lizard tribes → ~1200-1500 lizardfolk
- Shining Axes → 200-300 elite dwarves
- Assedroh + monks → ~20
- Local militias → ??
- Evereskan soldiers → ??
