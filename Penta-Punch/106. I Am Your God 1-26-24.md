Alex recap!

**Trauma Inspiration:** advantage on Con saving throws

  

Son: Patrick

- Bow, simple clothing, no armor
- Wears a teddy bear on his head

Granddad: Ethan

- “Has him and a walking stick”

  

Lio notices smoke slightly to our north(west)

Party starts stealthing, go to overlook to investigate area

- Ice has been melted all around this area
- Plenty of corpses
    - Dressed as if they just got out of bed
    - Lots of people holding tools
- Big ravine
- ~200 tents, most of them destroyed, 100+ bodies
- Looks like there’s one survivor

  

One individual where there’s a taller tent

- Hooded individual moving bodies
- Wearing more furs
    - Tosses bodies into fire, carves something into their head
- Chanting some necromantic magic
    - Erris recognizes it as Thayan
    - He’s attempting to Speak with Dead, but not exactly the same
    - “Spell of the new age” — recent history
- Elven lady he’s carving up has her hair burned

  

Erris flies above him and talks to him in Thayan

He’s a Tortle!?

- But without a shell
- Cultist-like markings on his face, similar to Thayan Red Wizard markings but modified
- Skin on the body’s face crumples up “like tinfoil” around the carving; then rips itself off and is sucked into the sigil. Body lays there
- He seems afriad
- Servant of Milan (?, we have no idea)
    - “My master. He will not be pleased, mortal”
    - If you interfere, you shall suffer the wrath of Ninfang
- Heavily scarred
    - “Please, relent”
- “I am Tamur Voss, do not hurt me God”
- He reverts to Aquan, begging for his life

“The Duke and the Lady will be very mad”

Fitz Magulgrbu — secret god

Northern Lady commanded

  

Great dragon killed all these people, everyone following “the Lady” to stop her “divine purpose”

Other ones have been scalped; this body has been messed up thoroughly

He tells us to speak with the dead; Lio goes through and stabs the sigils, releasing black fog

  

Grandad asks Vosse why he removed his shell

- “It was a great embarassment; it was taken”

Letza asks why Calibrizax went

- Went into the ravine, following the lady

  

“My Duke will save me from a bad afterlife”

Son threatens to take off his claws

  

He starts convulsing; Lio stabs him

  

More reversers/nullifiers come back

  

Great Tortle Wars are canon — between tortoises and turtles

NULLIFIERS VULNERABLE TO FIRE DAMAGE

  

Granddad is a “self-taught master” — Meth does not sense master energy

Son finds an “emerald pen”

  

Tortle had plenty of scars — “shifts in ownership”

- One of them is **very** familiar; symbol of Red Hand

We find the ravine

We jump down on some random box

Turns out there are numerous “boltholes”

Son finds a ledger with some assembled notes on the Netherese city **Palter**

- Direct quotes from someone who figured out this dig site discovered
- **Ewing Melan** discovered a “hollow” area with Magic Math
    - Not by visiting the area physically, but with magic
    - Maybe they’re either the Duke or Lady
- “Draconia Assimilation Plan” by Ewing Malon
    - Author’s note: “to **Maegona**, I hope my notes help you in this operation. Best of luck, my greatest apprentice.”

  

Body covered in snow

DC16 wisdom save to ask questions

Meth has an aversion to some shrine to an unspecified god, triggered “deep-seated trauma”

- White skull shattered in a black cowl, symbol of **Myrkul, Lord of Bones**
    - God of death, member of Dead Three
- Meth has a memory of someone saying “son, I’ll deal with them” while pulling them away from a ritual to Myrkul
    - speculation: Master Yu killed Meth’s parents???

  

Eventually Meth’s darkvision goes out, end of rope

Bottom unclear

  

Erris whistles the note to neutralize the antimagic??

We make it to the bottom

Looks like something big came down, crashed through 50 ft up

Heat-warped ice (indicates remorhaz’s)

Claustrophobic crawlspace at the bottom, but we just Wind Walk through it lol

We emerge and see a building sideways
