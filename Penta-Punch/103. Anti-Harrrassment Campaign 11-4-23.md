Warplady Levia says she’ll kill us unless we hand over Nali

She offers us a contract binding across planes — neither her nor anyone else will pursue us if we hand over Nali and agree to not continue further

Nali: Warplady Levia killed someone called “the Queen Mother”

- Nali has a boss?
- “Come home”
- Rene perception → doesn’t see anyone else
- Lio investigation → some other consciousness burined within Warplady Levia

Offscreen: obese one-eyed imp melds out of her, command her

- Another being looking like a cracked human doll comes out, tells her to look for people and offer them money

  

We teleport back to Immerstal’s and immediately smell burning

- Burning flesh
- Bottom floor has been completely sacked, dead child in the streets
- Whole city is FUCKED
    - Cathedral has been completely unscathed, everything else is fucked
- Bodies are a few hours old, blade wounds and burns; faces specifically seared
    - Retcon: many wounds bludgeoning tools/pitchforks as if they attacked each other
- Go to Jaarmath’s keep; guards are dead, home is burning

  

Go to the cathedral

- Mostly untouched except
- Immerstal, Jaarmath, Rima → arms, legs, heads, twisted bodies to string of words “you are next”
    - RIP
- In blood: “give me back my body”
- Two of “them” came through and killed everyone
    - One looked like Ant Hropol Ojist
    - Ameris is also dead
    - They came from Evereska
- Gold coin found on the statue of Penta-Punch: ‘

  

Hour passes, Erris digs a grave

- Coinlord representatives are dead; money is gone
- Two Mintfists have been “spaghettified”
- Invisible small-sized creature watching us → Meth kills it

  

Commune:

- Is the immediate location we teleport to with the planar amulet a safe place to rest? → Yes
- Even in death, does Rima love Erris? → Yes
- Will Rima agree to be Reincarnated? → No
- Is Rima's soul blocked from being resurrected→ No

CANON LORE: True Resurrection overrides willingness to return

  

Immerstal loot:

- Tuning fork to plane of Broth
- Half-built Wand of Wonder with one charge
- Teleport scroll

  

Make arrangements for other areas to support the survivors, use the amulet to teleport

Torchbearing people walk up towards monastery in the early morning

Erris emo arc; stays invisible

Flock of leopard sheep (??) near our camp

  

Town of tents nearby; seems like Draconia isn’t letting people in

- Meet some people: Gerebjorn (edgy guy), Neva (nice guy who welcomed us), Tobbefinkle (blacksmith)
- Monk in charge we can talk to: Harrrass
    - He can help us get into Draconia
- Interior of the monastery is beautiful, floor covered in dragon creation myth
- Only “dragontouched” can be declared masters
- Way into Draconia is called the **Thunderclaw Way**; blocked by a literal massive claw of quartz

We meet a group of dwarves (?)

- Leader Bureska, trying to force their way through the Thunderclaw by chipping it with tools
- Identify → draconic lord must place paw into seal and lift upwards; another could but would require high STR
- Letza → blue dragonborn, only one knowing why door is closed left looking for someone to open door
    - Royalty, great granddaughter (?) of Calabrizax one of the dragon lords
        - Unclear what exact relation is
    - Sibriex warned us of him
    - Disappeared, but told Harrrass
    - Described as a “good friend” of Bureska
- Door has abjuration and transmutation

### Looking for Harrrass

- Walk past monks fighting each other (wings)
- Meet some librarian who refuses entry even after Meth flares his ki
- Encounter a tan kobold in a stone zen garden, introduces himself as Master Harrrass, Master of the Dragon Style
    - He respects Meth for being a gold dragonborn more than his Master status because it hasn’t been bestowed by the dragon
    - We ask him about Letza, but he fucks off and leaves
- Meet another goliath monk
    - Journey here is troublesome “Past vaasa” → deems worthy based on Master Harrrass
    - He’s been a student for 4 years, just earned his wings
    - Vaasa is southeastish, 1000 miles from here
    - Letza was a student here, left a month ago and quit after diagreement with Harrrass
- Half gold/half hobgoblin dragonborn came here
    - Fuckin Azarr Kul

### Try again

- Meth offers to study under Master Harrrass
- Rene considers using Dream to harass him lmao
- Harrrass: “Learn how to fall without hitting the ground”
    - Non-answer, literally trolling
- Or paint 10,000 tiles

  

New idea: lift the entire thing by stacking buffs

- Letze left something to help Harrrass find her; he wasn’t happy when she left

  

Notice a changeling that the rest of the party recognizes (Theta-Nul?)

Blue dragonborn, “a little older”, wears glasses, wears frock/smock/monk clothes

  

Go back to the tent town to look for Letza

- Neva knows her, she went on a nature hike

  

We send Levia to talk to the Ananthabunta

- They’re looking at a weird map with fake locations that they try to hide
- They know where she went?
    - Towards Anauroch
- They offer to trade us their map for ours, safe passage, and a game of “Eagle-meleon racing”
- Tower of Leomund allegedly built before Draconia, ruins could have a passway

  

Plan: dream-harass Harrrass, then steal if that doesn’t work, then try to force the door

Dream: gold dragon appears, “Meth is my Champion, help him pass the Thunderclaw Way or this will be your doom”

- Letze falling into void, monastery painted in blood of students, monastery under assault by Warpknights, Warplady Levia personally kills a dragon
