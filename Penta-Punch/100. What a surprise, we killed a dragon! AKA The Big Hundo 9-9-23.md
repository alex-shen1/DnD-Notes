Decide to head off in the direction of **Proskur**

- Tigre gets “directionally confused” while leading us, arrive 13 miles out
- Land near a camp, discover an abandoned Zhentarim pin
- Random tombstones around the town; townsfolk notice us but we go by too fast
- Arrive at Proskur — “small ring of buildings” around a large, fortified citadel
    
    - Much smaller than Evereska; half the size of Talar
    - Small ring of buildings called **Traveler’s Respite**

- Meth notices scorch marks on the outside of the moat
- Lio and Nali prefer staying out of the city; we find accommodations rather easily
    - But have to split up

Guy references “purple dragon guy”

- “Cormyrians have a high and mighty attitude”
- **History check:** purple dragon is the symbol of Cormyr
- Some Hunt Crown (?) Rebellion happened
- Capital of Cormyr is **Suzail**

Some guy contacted Rene, suggested allying with the leader of the Zhent (Sememmon)

- Zhentarim are leaving Neverwinter (maybe moving to Darkhold)?
- idk context

  

Levia is oddly persistent about going through the Giant’s Run Mountains

Meth remembers something called **Cairnheim** in the Giant’s Run Mountains

Nali prefers mountains; surprised when we tell her dragons are hostile

Meth rolls a nat 1 while leading us so we end up in the mountains anyway LOL

  

Hear sounds of someone hacking at trees with a sword

Armor painted purple

With elf + tiefling in chainmail

He’s there surveying on classified business; no lake nearby

He commands his followers to take us back to their camp

They let us off the hook, telling us to not go west (and refuse to answer any questions)

  

Party rests again near a lake at the edge of the forest

- Meth: goal is to get Nali where she needs to be, “maybe kill some people”
    - Approached from behind by elderly (half?) elven lady carrying a hooked stick with a lantern
    - Introduces herself as Behrshimmer; says only a few people come by, and very few stick around to appreciate the nature like Meth
    - She dislikes the Cormyrians for deforesting
    - “Emberspeak has a long memory, and a cold heart, and is practically immortal. Key word being practically”

  

The party questions whether or not Meth was dreaming

Meth’s new dream: be old and mysterious and go around bullshitting adventurers

Commune:

- Was Meth’s encounter real? → yes
- Can we reason with Emberspeak? → unclear
- A sequence of Emberspeak damage effectiveness questions
    - “Non-psychic” → yes
    - Psychic → yes
- Emberspeak know about Hoid’s vault? → yes
    - Live in or within 1 mile of? → no

Erris has a skill issue navigating

Stop for the night

- We encounter an abandoned tower → Tiger realizes that it’s a remnant of the Land Druids who used to live around here
- More communes lul
    - Emberspeak at his most powerful, can he be damaged by the dragon slaying sword? → yes
    - Is our marked location of Hoid’s vaults within 50 miles of it’s actual location? → unclear
    - Is there any types of damage that Emberspeak is particularly vulnerable to? → yes

We continue west across the flat plains — delayed by Levia navigation skill issues

Next morning commune:

- Is Emberspeak within 100 miles → no
- ??
- In your opinion, is Emberspeak evil? → no
- In _our_ opinion? → unclear
- 150 miles? → yes
- Are we evil? → not evil, just meddlesome, Child of the Twine (?)

We finally reach the mountains → they’re pretty low

As we land, sudden event → “shock wave of wind” hits everyone except Lio and Erris

- Emberspeak shows up; 90% of Abythriax, but HUGE wings
- Tigre uses action to Search for weakness → dagger stuck in the side of dragon
- Erris pulls out the dagger with Telekinesis
    - We need to use it to lower his AC — 1 per hit
    - Meth runs a relay to pass it from Erris to Levia and move her to Clap
    - Vision: some druid in the past swore to Silvanus that this twig would kill the dragon
        - So nothing else can affect him
        - Bruh
- We kill him, continue in gas form
- Lio notices a hurting goat; rotted portion of skin on a lamb
    - Dispel Magic works; it ebbs for a little
    - Arcana check → it’s a curse
    - Levia successfully casts Remove Curse → “goat friend”, named Billy
- Tigre talks to the goat the next day
    - Has no sense of time or counting
    - Refuses to answer about how it got hurt
    - “Big stone angry tree” → probably cursed by vault
    - “Mountain. Near. Cross water and look at old druid house. Then pass creek and angry tree and rocks”
- We set off on mounts
