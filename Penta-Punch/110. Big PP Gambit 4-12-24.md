[[PP Gambit]]

PP GAMBIT COOKING

He burns 2 legendary actions on unidentified spell — Erris blocks

Son investigate Arcana:

- Position for “bipedal” to place hands and trigger surge
- Cost action and Arcana check to activate

  

Statue angry at Son→ runs forward to attack, but Levia lands HUGE sentinel hit

- Striking foot hurts
- Attacks redirected into Levia → one misses, but she goes down

  

Lio is COOKING with pixie Confusion

- Only has +1 to WIS saves, no legendary saves left

METH STUN METH STUN

- +11 to CON saves

  

The statue getting possessed actually weakened it

Statue voice says “you’re too late.”

  

### Turn 2

Son investigates again, rolls 17

- Most of city seems to have organically grown, but there’s an avenue straight line pointing from pedestal to spire
- Looks like there might be some magical connection from this pedestal to the spire….?

Rene activates glyphs with Son’s assistance → rolls 28 on DC 22 Arcana

- “Red flash” from glyphs; “violent red energy” flickers on the tower
- Spellcasting ability check → rolls 10 :(
    - “Multitude of whispers” — “what would you have us do?”
    - Rene thinks “Deactivate” — explosion from pedestal, “loud banging noise” (soundboard)
    - Red magic washes all over the entire area…unclear what it did

Statue asks (in Loross) for us to kill → notably different voice than before, which was Common

- Common voice then says “my master will destroy you”

Additional investigation

- We think we deactivated a shield of some kind?
- Voices were separate/not related to first effect

STATUE IS RESISTANT TO FIRE, POSSIBLY ABSORBS IT

Levia kills

GRANDDAD BACK

We destroyed “a majority” of the Ninfang forces

  

Surge of magical energy radiating from spire — seems like forcefield was containing it

“Intense magical artifact”

  

One notably large building — labeled “Bazaar of the Bizarre” in Loross

Loot bodies

Another arcane surge — suspect someone is fucking with the mythallar (”arcane battery” used to do weather prediction and float the city)

Scrolls:

- Summon Hell — Bone Devil in an unoccupied space; contested will check to control
- Other scroll is just a message
    - Written by “M” — Magorna?
    - “Residents of Palter grow restless. I will handle Stismareth

  

QUEST COMPLETE

Hear screams and “moaning” in the night

### Next Day

Decide to go directly to military district + enter spire

  

In square:

- Wights attacking giant zombies; zombies attacking

Undead might be from the city; aberrations are Ninfang?

  

Our Stealth rolls are trash → decide to just leave before we get spotted

- Go towards mythallar

Rubble to hide? Or direct route

- Direct route, take the fight if it happens

“Wires” look carved in the floor

Magic energy is strong enough to feel

We see figures at the mythallar, they haven’t noticed us

- We see “large sized figures”

Someone is chanting an invocation at the mythallar

Behind: 2 model 738-TI, flesh mournling and frost giant, 2 Miskakan Series 1

Floating skull sees Lio immediately lol

“You are not of Ninfang” → no

- “I am Stismareth. You know my name?”
- “Me and my army shall bring Palter from the ground, and we shall rule the Surface again”
- “I have taken control of Ninfang”
    - They awoke him
- Maegona is his acolyte and killed Calibrizax
- Identifies Lio’s magic proficiency, offers a job as “High General”
    - Seeking to find works of other inventors; aspires to build a large magimation army
- He buys the deception; instructs Lio to find Caksde’s body

Maegona betrays Stismareth

- Mythallar changes color to dark purple, “spinning wave of magic”
    - Globe of Invulnerability, with a mild gravitational effect
- Maegona has Bag of Holding → pulls out a potion rack
    - “8 potions and a jar floating above her head”
    - “A vial of wyvern’s blood, manticore venom, arsenic, crused belladonna, crushed unicorn horn, griffin’s blood, vampire’s blood, pint of alcohol” + heart of lover
    - Stismareth visibly shocked, “you can’t do this to me”
- Erris recognizes this as a Ritual of Lich Ascension
    - Second part requires “great magical prowess”
    - Liches have phylacteries, but not when they’re created
    - Demiliches are below full liches; Maegona is attempting to become a lich
- Maegona calls upon Myrkul to witness ascension
    
    !! spectre appears, disappears after a short while

Son shoots a bottle, does 12 damage → not enough → another 8 enough

- Griffin’s blood bottle explodes, liquid is still floating but rendered inert
- She needs only 5 of the 9 items to complete the ritual
- Shoot alcohol w/ 18, not enough

**Maegona has 8+ legendary actions**

Mythallar is creating the Globe; not a spell casting (thus cannot be dispelled)

Summons don’t work here

Rene casting Shatter at 7th level

Maegona pulls Stismareth into the mixture; he begins to scream

EVERYONE IS IMMUNE TO STUN

Amaunator talks to Levia → she rages at him (crisis of faith??)

Levia kills Maegona, but!

### Dracolich

Erris completes kill

Granddad was pretty sure Dad was never in Palter

- He knew he was dead the whole time??

Return my allies souls and bodies to this morning’s strength.

Rene pulls off Grehik healing → only 5 though

- Nali regained arms! But doesn’t remember who we are
    - Sees Meth as Might
    - Visibly younger
- Granddad rejuvenated to (turtle years) 30s, but doesn’t remember having a son

- Caksde heals up

Mythallar extinguished
