Inspiration: +5 temp HP!

Traps were magical!

Tyroche is scared of cats lmao

Lio introduces himself as “Olly Coppersmith”

- In response, Tyroche mentions a “Lionsguard”

Greenish tint to his veins – not common to elves

- He can photosynthesize!?
- That’s how he survived
- “Old blood in the family”
- Enchantment magic on him causing this

Bars and a lever right next to us, mechanical device

- Loud noise as bars go up into the ceiling

“Forward til trapdoor” in Elvish

Open the door 🡪 Meth gets shot 3 times

Guy comes through 🡪 immediately gets shot and killed by Rene

We get shot at through holes in the wall

Lio creates wolves

The other guy who ran away got attacked/killed by vampire-like beings (not vampires though)

Another goblin decaying in the same hallway – wearing a cloak that looks knawed on

Generic elvish literature – shifted furniture, maybe a table? 8 or 9 ft wide

- Elvish sprinter, got chased by god of the hunt across the entirety of Faerun

Raindrops – shitton of rats

Vampire lady – once an elf, put in a cell by a suitor

- Abandoned here (by the elves?)
- “He” – some vampire – came here and corrupted the place
    - has a “new woman”
- Onions/garlic hanging from the ceiling
- Sustains herself with rat friends
- 58 scratch marks – been in here for 58 years
- Born in the “Knife Ward” – describes Evereska as the “greatest city ever”

River part of the Elsir Basin

Don’t pick up dagger or open closet

There are other women – Lady is the longest wife

Orbs are the key

We have green

Gray, pink – gray prevents golem

Doppleganger – known in Thay for kidnapping children

RIP Lady

Two notable enemies: Galanthrax the Quick (druid, 9.5 ft tall) and Anchorite of the Red (cast Lightning Bolt)

Enemies can speak Draconic (and so can Lio’s special wildshape form)

Tyroche knows magic missile but rolled dogshit and got incapacitated lmao

Galanthrax becomes “lizardlike” – he’s a green dragon!

“Take the chain and flee! Do not let them take the hands”

- Prayer beads let him cast better

Galanthrax breath weapons Snake-Oil (Lio) + Meth + Erris

Erris blasted out of the sky with a breath weapon, caught by Snake-Oil’s tail

15 inch chain, fits in a hand cleric attunment!
