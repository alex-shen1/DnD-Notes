"Poor luck" – won an instant fortress in an auction, had it stolen in a robbing
- Went to some auction in the Wide held after sunset
- Big fan of Miner's Exchange
- Doesn't like the city and wants to explore, wanted to buy the fortress to finally move out

Potential targets: "thugs and vagabonds" associated with former owner of the fortress
- Looks like a rook from a chess set, grows to "true castle" when command word spoken
- Former owner of the tower would be known by auctioneers
- Bi-monthly thing, could be selling at Gazmo's Auctions at the Wide
- Seems to be
- Was robbed after sunset while after passing through Baldur's Gate, headed to the Counting House
	- 2 days ago, auction was 4 days ago
	- Opened an account with the Coinlords of Xiash
- Other bidders: silversmith Hodrick Towar, "dressed poor", aarakocra heiress ("Klei?") who bid a trifling amount
	- Bid was 150,000 gold
	- Klei lives down the street, Hodrick left

Ivory strips are made from loxodon (elephant people) shavers, which is illegal

Asks some random guy → gets punched
ASKS A LOXODON → lies, claims to be taking them down
Fish person on the street → Aquaman the drug dealer

Proprietor named Ethan welcomes us
Letza joins us, we get a private booth to discuss strategy
Commune:
- Do Hunin/Mertyl have it? → Yes
- Are they in the city? → Yes
- Are they downstairs? → Yes

Send Luna and Lio (as a spider) downstairs to investigate
- We see a LOT of beer barrels, large barrel on its side
- Lio unmorphs, checks for secret doors. "Definitely something here"

Lio opens the door while invisible → tunnel entrance, dimly-lit secondary tavern with ~20 people who all notice
- 2 people come in looking, kobold and old human. Lio and Luna make it inside

Secondary bar not as well-stocked, but still plenty of variety
Door controlled by lever
- We spot the female drow and half-orc
