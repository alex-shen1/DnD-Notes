- Penta-Punch has been signed up for an adventurer’s tournament of all the heroes along the Sword Coast
- The gang:
    - Rene looking for archivist, checks in every few days w/ Sending
    - Meth went with monks
    - Lio to find Tomer
    - The three of them went to Neverwinter?
    - Levia trying to go back home

Gonna resume a year after the Red Hand

- Won in 1238 (near the eve of 1239), so we’ll be starting in 1239

  

3 days after, Levia leaves, Rene says she’ll be leaving for a while

Second month of the year, Rene says she met Meth/Lio on the search for Tomer

They found him a few days later, slightly hurt, magic item for me

No contact with Levia for 3-5 months; gods assure Rene via Commune that she’s ok

  

Erris meets a nomad, saying that going south through the Darkhold (Far Hills?) means they have services for that, past the plains, past the Northdark, it’s 300 miles

Researching at Immerstal to fact check while Rima/Immerstal study planar magic

Discover a deliberately fictional almanac, containing a very old map:

![[Untitled 38.png|Untitled 38.png]]

Darkhold is a structure of some kind

Estimated on foot 300 miles — ~10 day trip there

  

Prestidigitation, Fire Bolt, Light, Mage Hand

Detect Magic, Mage Armor, Shield, Magic Missile, Misty Step, Suggestion, Counterspell, Fireball, Fly, Phantom Steed, Greater Invisibility, Ice Storm, Cone of Cold

She’s only level 5 though; other spells are from the spell book

  

Almost end of first month of the year, people getting used to the Coinlords, people sympathetic to the servants/slaves

  

We both get Phantom Steed

## Leaving

### Day 1:

Cloudy overhead

Compasses don’t work in this world thanks to Selûne

Head south through the hills — straight line to the Pelleor’s Prairie

Almanac has weird made up things, mentions the Queen of the Hunt, goblin eat a sword

### Day 2:

Veer off-track into the “Battle of Bones”

No grass, just dirt

Find a half-buried helmet fit for a halfling, but with large ears

**Battle of Bones Helmet** — not Common, Elvish, Celestial, Dwarvish, or Aquan (not magical)

_Detect Magic_ picks up conjuration and necromancy magic all over the ground

Dim lights float up into the air from the ground, start whizzing around

Large creature lumbering around on the distant hills

### Day 3

Land is very flat, Sunset Mountains green/blueish in the distance

Get to the Skull Gorge, very deep, can barely see the other side

Separate ecosystem down in the canyon — animals that seem to be native

Beetle giraffe (armored hide)

Something plunges from the sky into the gorge, large blue creature (dragon?) swoops down and picks up the giraffe

See a “large log” in the water with bumps on its back moving towards us, green eyes

Get attacked by a giant crocodile!

### Day 3

Fly up, see a clearing + bridge

A singular two-story tavern in the middle of the clearing

Tavern’s name is **Death’s End**, ornately carved sign

Large tavern, staircase, very well lit, long bar

Some shoddy-looking half-orc lady taking a drink, looks like she just woke up, wearing peasant garb

Young boy playing an instrument

Surprise to hear we’re passing through

Orcish lady is **Tamad**

Two footsteps coming downstairs

Sus about infrequent guests

Dwarf dressed in ranger’s robes comes downstairs, gold cufflinks

Kid’s named **Tuck**

Investigate upstairs

2 white painted doors, black painted door, 2 doors with red paint

- Black door locked
- White doors have double made beds in each
    - Everything here coated in dust
- Red doors locked

Outside is oddly clean

  

“He’s watching.”

Whole place is divination magic

Coming from the woods, is the dwarf

Old, blue eyes

Turns out dwarf is a blue dragon

RIP kids

Kids were captured recently 150 miles west from a caravan

  

Burn the building down

History check: blue dragons can go insane, stay in ruins

  

Corm Orp is a real town, but it’s called Littleton

Very sad and old, no kids

Give us free lodging

### Day X

We stay for a while, get courier service

We arrive at Darkhold, a town like Ivarstead (Skyrim) underneath a place like this — the art is only the side buildings, main thing is even bigger

![[Untitled 1 24.png|Untitled 1 24.png]]

Flags on the castle:

![[Untitled 2 14.png|Untitled 2 14.png]]

Investigating the little buildings yields little, main door also doesn’t move, but there are indications that the door can open

There is not wind enough to twirl  
That one red leaf, nearest of its clan,  
Which dances as often as dance it can.  

  

The answer was fire lmao

Hot air comes in (whispered air: come in)

Drawn upward

Hallways have been long been pillaged

Go up into a _huge_ room (twice as large as the queen’s rooms), someone sitting on a throne

Near the top of the castle

Withered old person, sunken eyes, wiry thin white hair (almost bald), very tall human (?)

Wearing puffy black robes, presumably living i.e. not a lich

Wearing a black circlet/crown tightly around the head, light from a window

Dude says everything is taken already, we’re free to look around

All of his fingers on one hand have been cut off

He’s forgotten his name, and will forget us

Crown makes him hurt intensely, person was a tiefling whose horns were shaved away

Erris dispels the magic on his crown, he regains vitality (but is still very old)

Is albino, blind

He remembers!

**Sememmon**

Was once lord of Darkhold, did bad things

He attempts to cast something on Rima but fails

We let him go

  

Retroactive notes: betrayed; left to rot

He owes me a life debt

Was once a stronghold of the Zhentarim
