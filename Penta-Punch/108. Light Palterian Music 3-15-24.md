Mrinaal recap

Retcon: amulet is now a dagger

“Cold gut inspiration”: CON saves are made with +2

We open by taking a short rest

Granddad still has PTSD from losing his friends Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatallo, and Raphael

Letza asks Erris if he’s had any traumatic losses → comforted by Granddad, who now views Erris as the new Donatello

Nali: dragonborn had wings where she’s from

  

### Fourth encounter:

Enter some other room, big door

Enter room; walls made of magic stone

Random runes on the walls

Room with random lines across it (”like a dry cleaner”)

The stone seems to resist magic?

Hooks designed to hold something human sized??

Tesselating pattern in the room; ends near raised platform

Previous room has completely vanished; wall where there was once a hallway

Room suddenly gets very cold — 5d0 cold damage, people who fail take exhaustion

We realize we’re in a fridge -_-

Son discovers buttons with Elvish on the “Heat up” and “Termination”

**Loross —** old Elvish variant; used by the Palterians/Netherese

- Heat up → orange glow happens
- Termination → sound of stuff turning off

Other words hidden in pattern: “Magimation Sanitation Chamber”

Whole place was a dead end lul

  

Go back → rest up in an abandoned bathroom

“The tortoises are barbaric creatures”

Arcane mortars deployed in defense of “Turtletopia” → soon abandoned after the war

- Moonshae (??) Isles
- Granddad deshelled tortoise POWs

### Fifth encounter: superstructure (?)

Upside-down wizard’s tower of some kind

Find a crawlspace in the attic to natural tunnels — looks like bottom of glacier

Wooden doors — clearly entrance to something important

- Doors very rotten; easily opened

![[Untitled 53.png|Untitled 53.png]]

Looks like some old library

Son finds an old Elvish stonebound book

- Netherese history of necromancy; figuring out life/death magic without divine magic + using arcane magic to animate constructs

Erris finds palm-shaped disc of magic metal with thumbprint on it

- Lose a first-level spell slot, but glowing text appears
- Ultimate Moon: The Meeting of the Greatest Two Arcane Minds of a Generation
- Speaks of someone called **Stismareth** — supposedly “shook hands with the **All-Seeing Eye Nethys**”
    - Nethys supposedly found “love” for Stismareth as an apprentice
    - “Strong connection” built Paleter; separated from the Netherese Empire
    - Speaks of the figures with reverence — author views them as gods
    - No attributed author

A “presence” enters the chamber

- Feminine voice from the statue: “What are your intentions in Palter?” → find our friends
    - “Are you tired?” → No → “We will force you to rest with us for eternity”
- Scream → DC 16 WIS save

“Nuclear-green” energy around the statue — coalesces into this blob: a **Haunt**!

Says “We recognize you — touched by the death god” to Meth

“Liberate our souls. Free us from this haunt”

### Encounter 6:

We go down this cramped staircase into some basement

Very old books (lots rotted)

Books written by **Bynaus Vmere**

- Engineering vibes?
- “Biomimicry”

Operation table with a statue on it

![[Untitled 2 20.png|Untitled 2 20.png]]

Made **Miskakan Series 1** — built for war and masonry

- Basically a warforged??
- “Skywhale oil tanks”

Room starts rumbling/lighting up, similar to before

Meth presses a button; desks are trapped and blow up

“I fight for Magorna. Trespassers must be terminated”

![[Untitled 3 12.png|Untitled 3 12.png]]

Everyone on the team has a skill issue

Vulnerable to fire

Lio loots a chest with some writing → references to accounts, transfer of some sort

- Also finds a locket

Erris shoots (aided by Letza), detonates all the whale oil and obliterates it

  

Another projection disc — bends at a 90 degree angle (like a bent coin)

![[Untitled 4 7.png|Untitled 4 7.png]]

- Projects a 5ft tall beam of red light
- Some guy’s face pops up

![[Untitled 5 6.png|Untitled 5 6.png]]

- Looks like a tiefling without horns; unclear if red or just the light effect
    - Glitched like a rewinding VCR
- “Hello. I am Bynaus Vmere.”
    - Only responds to Erris
- What can you tell me about yourself?→ Developer of devices, “chief among arcanists”
- What information can you tell me? → I have much information stored in this copy
- Why did Palter fall out of the sky? → I do not understand
- “If you’re seeing this image, I am dead.”
    - Anything important → in the middle of constructing my latest work. Most valuable thing to me.
- Years are not counted in our age
    - Doesn’t know what the Spellplague is
- Will lie if it is in his interests
    - His interest: defeating his rivals in the industrialization of Palter
    - Any proper mage of Palter should know — rivals are **Stismareth** (archmarge/warmonger), Caksde (built things to help people), Drakareth (who built arcane batteries), and Muccan (security systems)
- Assesses us as being useful
    - “Insert slot in the back, insert the chip to return him”
    - He was making more, there was only one
    - Other units may be in warehouses in Central Palter; he was hired by Stismareth to build an army of them
- Spellbook would’ve been with him when he died
- The statue that took Levia/Rene is the **Netherese Golem** — Palterian statue
    - Stismareth’s “only claim to fame”, supposedly the greatest Netherese work of Palter
    - Would likely go to Spire of Stismareth in the center of Palter
    - Warehouse 2 circles away from the center of Palter
    - Circle = platform that makes up Palter, separately floating platforms
- Spire is grand and opulent, “hard to miss”
- He can only respond to sound, no visual capacity
- 3rd level slot: 50 ft of bright light, another 50 ft of dim light
- Not authorized to talk about Nethys
- Options:
    - Shutoff all **Miskakan Series 1**
    - Activation is done independently via infusing a lot of arcane energy
    - Insertion of the disk into the head will control the unit
    - Play music — costs a 5th level spell slot

Lio finds an illusion locket

- Locket contains an image of the Miskakan Series 1

Through the tunnel, and we see
