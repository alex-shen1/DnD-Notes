Entrance closed behind us as we entered the maze

Still need red, blue, yellow, gray to deactivate golem

Tyroche needs sunlight to power his magic

High ceiling in the central area with stalagmites

Body of bioluminescent water, “bell-topped mushrooms” around, glowing puddle

Tent has emptied-out weapon racks, table with a map + papers + pens

Other tent: box with lid fused down, black powder on the outside – explosive box!

Medical supplies and food!

Map details a “Weave Barrier”

Red Hand might be led by “Xaersoissurth”

Greenish explosion – we got caved in

Hidden doorway where someone got stuck lmao

We experimented with detonating it underwater – it was right on top of Galanthrax omegalul

“Something pinkish” in the water

Galanthrax = 14 AC without mage armor

Red Hand War Priest – AC <= 14

Monk AC <= 16 – they’re ki blockers that can’t be stunned

Levia has a “comfy but cold” dream sequence – in a “nice tavern”

Sitting across from a “Meth-sized goblin” wearing a suit, melodic voice

Per person revives become more difficult (DC 10 for first revival)

Galanthrax got owned by the quippers RIP

Lio gave Levia a revive statue, we got Galanthrax body parts, healing potions, gold

Evil medallion attached to his body, it fused into his flesh but is cracked and broken

Metal wand imprinted with the banner of the Red Hand

“Heavy metallic foot steps up a hill”

Golos and Hoid together in Evereska, thick fog and sees them being watched – ponders why specifically they were selected as worthy

- Hoid worried about us <3
- Make it over a ridge, see a valley with 7 hills. They’ve arrived!
- 30-story skyscrapers
- Stone metropolis, silent
- They’ve been abducted!
