# Lizards

Surrounded by lizardmen holding metal weapons

- Leader emerges wearing “swamp camo”
- He asks if we’re Red Hand
- The entire band is pretty wounded
- Meth mentions the eggs and they advance further

They take us to their camp!

- They mention a “winged god” (probably a dragon) and its keeper
    - They mention that it’s “night” colored (black dragon?)
    - Black dragons spew acid breath, but they don’t have acid burns; instead fiery
    - Could be a fire giant?
- Small camps like it encircle the lake

- Lizards want us to go to the big building while they go to the tower
    - They want us to destroy the eggs if they’re in bad condition
    - They give us some boats

## Strategizing

- Alcohol neutralizes the black dragon’s throat lining
- Black dragons are the most evil of all the chromatic dragons — loot fallen people
    - Hate weak people, build lairs in ruins
    - Known for sadism
    - Target the weakest enemy first
    - Most likely native to Material Plane, but some can planeshift
- Enemies:
    - Black dragon
    - Probably a wyrmlord
    - Fiery giant (?)

# The Approach

- 2 per boat, Meth walking on water
- We see signs of previous lizardfolk attacks — dead hobgoblins on older belltowers
- We almost get spotted by a searchlight
- Meth assassinates a guy, but not before he shouts for help
- Levia gets caught out by a Red Hand Giant!

- New air elemental name: Martin the Destroyer, Slayer of Giants
- Iormel’s Special tastes like Play-Doh

  

We slay the giant, but hear a commotion at the belltower

- Lizards are attacking!
- Celestial picks up Rene and Erris, Levia picks up Lio, Meth runs with the sharks
- There are 2 other giants!!

  

We land on the roof of the big building
