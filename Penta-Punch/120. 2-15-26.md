Erris + Lio get slept by some magic, Meth survives 
His name is "The Big"
![[Pasted image 20260215202427.png|200]]
"Sentinel of Edwyrm"

He picks us up and flies us away
- Takes us to "The Big's Hoard 1"
- Can control the weather with magic

Erris wakes having had pleasant dreams, Tigre asleep for 20 hours YIKES

METH HAS THE PASSWORD TO THE HOARD
- his password is "my voice is not dumb" in old (?) draconic
- uttering the phrase in this location creates a "traditional-looking dragon cave"

- the entire hoard is an illusion :( 

Being detained under suspicion of being a threat. Edwyrm is "technically part of his domain"
- Meth is suspected as missing child of the Paragon
- Nabapu (gardener?) would be annoyed or something if he didn't deal with it?


Play a game with Meth – Erris quits because he's massively cheating
- Erris investigates, seemingly no magic blockers
- Wall of Force generated by a glyph, possibly generating other spells
	- Evocation, illusion, necromancy
