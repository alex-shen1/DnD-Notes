Erris + Lio get slept by some magic, Meth survives 
His name is "The Big"
![[Pasted image 20260215202427.png|200]]
"Sentinel of Edwyrm"

He picks us up and flies us away
- Takes us to "The Big's Hoard 1"
- Can control the weather with magic

Erris wakes having had pleasant dreams, Tigre asleep for 20 hours YIKES

METH HAS THE PASSWORD TO THE HOARD
- his password is "my voice is not dumb" in old (?) draconic
- uttering the phrase in this location creates a "traditional-looking dragon cave"
![[Pasted image 20260215204141.png|600]]
- the entire hoard is an illusion :( 

Being detained under suspicion of being a threat. Edwyrm is "technically part of his domain"
- Meth is suspected as missing child of the Paragon
- Nabapu (gardener?) would be annoyed or something if he didn't deal with it?


Play a game with Meth – Erris quits because he's massively cheating
- Erris investigates, seemingly no magic blockers
	- Wall of Force generated by a glyph, possibly generating other spells
	- Evocation, illusion, necromancy
	- Rug has magic (enchantment, illusion, conjuration), and pile of carcasses (necromancy, abjuration, illusion)
	- Doorway glyph has divination

"How do we get to the temple of abject pain? (i.e. where the Grehik rune is, below the Crag)"
- Go through opening in Garden of Io
- Pass traps of disinvited – Wall of Disintegration if not welcome, get key from garden
- go past great winged ones
- side corridor heading to ruins – old markings related to Orog Empire


### The Plan?
Erris soundblasts Lio/Tigre to wake them up, Tigre gets up
Recall -> Deep Ethereal is timeshifted. Nali/Rene might not come back for a while
- While discussing, get Sending from Rene: "In ethereal. Nali safe. On our way back soon TM."

DC 25 INT save: Levia is no longer on Toril, so forget 1 memory


Find a random tunnel to another place. Seems similar but many scorch marks
- Copper dragons are rare. 
- Same element as Regiaryx -> acid/poison?
- Blue liquid is goopy, but not seddham

Erris conjures a demiplane for funsies (Goop Plane)
- Meth throws some goop into my demiplane. "It jiggles a little bit"
- Tigre throws another scoop to the right
-
