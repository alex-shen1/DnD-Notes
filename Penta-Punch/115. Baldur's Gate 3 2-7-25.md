Erris recap
- Outer City Public Library – "free to all"
	- Most dogshit library I have ever seen
- Again → hippie satyr with a library on wheels
	- Erris donates his Old Elvish books

### Start
Morning: Levia attempt to wake up Rene → she swings her mace and hits Lio
- Rene and Lio are wearing ridiculous party outfits, went to a "banger party"
- Rene is wearing furs to look like an owlbear, Lio is wearing garish green outfit

Knock at the door – short, ruddy, dust-covered "newsie" gnomish boy at the door
- Hands us an envelope and leaves
- "To Todd"
	- Nice envelope with a heart
	- Fingerprint in the page, "touch me"
	- Rene Identify → Spoken letter, enchanted to relay message
	- Tigre touches → Thaumaturgy plays a sultry voice from his mistress, she bore his child Todd Jr.

Teleport back to the monastery
### Monastery
Show up in the monastery, sneak through the early morning
Thunderclaw Way gate is open, so all the people camped out there are gone
- Sun canonically rises in the west
We get steeds and move through the tunnel

Walk for 20 minutes with no end in sight, eventually feel wind

Letza lore drop
- There are yellow dragons, running another entrance near Icewind Dale. Letza's dead ancestor was the protector of this entrance
- The Paragon: gold dragon, supposedly built up Draconia. Gained power from Crag of Eons, forged shelter for dragons in the mountains. Revered as a deity
	- Capital city is **Edwyrm**, in the shadow of the Crag, seat of the Paragon
	- Nobody has seen the Paragon in a while? 
- Heavily guarded tax collector comes from Edwyrm every now and then
	- Space works differently in here – the Thunderclaw way was a gateway?

### Surfacing
Make it through after 3 hour walk
Hot, dusty air – bright sunlight
