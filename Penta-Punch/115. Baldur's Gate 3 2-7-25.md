Erris recap
- Outer City Public Library – "free to all"
	- Most dogshit library I have ever seen
- Again → hippie satyr with a library on wheels
	- Erris donates his Old Elvish books

### Start
Morning: Levia attempt to wake up Rene → she swings her mace and hits Lio
- Rene and Lio are wearing ridiculous party outfits, went to a "banger party"
- Rene is wearing furs to look like an owlbear, Lio is wearing garish green outfit

Knock at the door – short, ruddy, dust-covered "newsie" gnomish boy at the door
- Hands us an envelope and leaves
- "To Todd"
	- Nice envelope with a heart
	- Fingerprint in the page, "touch me"
	- Rene Identify → Spoken letter, enchanted to relay message
	- Tigre touches → Thaumaturgy plays a sultry voice from his mistress, she bore his child Todd Jr.

Teleport back to the monastery
### Monastery
Show up in the monastery, sneak through the early morning
Thunderclaw Way gate is open, so all the people camped out there are gone
- Sun canonically rises in the west
We get steeds and move through the tunnel

Walk for 20 minutes with no end in sight, eventually feel wind

Letza lore drop
- There are yellow dragons, running another entrance near Icewind Dale. Letza's dead ancestor was the protector of this entrance
- The Paragon: gold dragon, supposedly built up Draconia. Gained power from Crag of Eons, forged shelter for dragons in the mountains. Revered as a deity
	- Capital city is **Edwyrm**, in the shadow of the Crag, seat of the Paragon
	- Nobody has seen the Paragon in a while? 
- Heavily guarded tax collector comes from Edwyrm every now and then
	- Space works differently in here – the Thunderclaw way was a gateway?

### Surfacing
Make it through after 3 hour walk
Hot, dusty air – bright sunlight
- Seems like seasons change every week, currently in a dry season

A prospector comes by on a wagon and curses at us

Long walk – arrive at **Gate Town**
![[Pasted image 20250207220210.png|300]]

Encounter black dragonborn and dwarf
- Tigre throws dirt and says happy Dwarvish new year
- They recognize Letza
This place uses different currency – gem-based, denominated in "scales"

Colosseum looking thing is a shrine to Bahamut – "all welcome, sinners especially"
- Place is run by an old blind gold dragonborn **Valuth Embing** (??) – scales have dulled
- Tigre and Levia immediately leak the assassination plot to him
- Ask him for help getting to Edwyrm
	- He recommends waiting for the weather to clear up
	- Claims the weather is controlled by Paragon/Bahamut
		- Also claims to have weather prediction powers
- Distantly related to the Paragon
- "What wind is the most virtuous?"
	- Erris confidently says west → wrong omegalul. it's north
	- Meet with **Balazar Ironclaw** (?) – recommendations on safe travel
		- Find him in large orange building, 2nd floor
	- He warns us that drought is a dangerous time 
- He offers us dinner and lodging in the shrine 

Letza was born here so she has a house separately. Leaving the party

Rene casts Dream on Nali while she sleeps, gives her a dream of her being attacked
Levia tries to invade the Warplady's mind??
Soaking?

### Next Morning
Awoken by shrine guy ringing bell

Immediately go to building → has tavern on the first floor, sheriff station on top?
Red leather door with gold handle – very ornate, seems out of place here

Sitting at desk is **Balazar** – short, 3-horned bronze dragonborn missing left eye and a left horn
- Gives us map – shows us Edwyrm and Chenfels (other town)
- Offers us "abomination"
- Aurochs (?) – gray, have tusks, 2 legs, tribal, attack and rob travelers
- Offers us scale if we escort Kravaka (ranger type) right outside Edwyrm
	- She is leaving on important mission (?)
	- Intense fear of magic
	- Black dragonborn, "stereotypical cowboy" 

We meet Krakava she kinda rude, offers us 20 emerald
- How much is that? No idea omegalul
- Ditch her

Wind walk → EZ HEX DASH
- Fly over town ("described next time")
- See turbo path
