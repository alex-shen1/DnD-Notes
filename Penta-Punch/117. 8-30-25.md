Ethan recap
Inspo: -2 AC for any objects being attacked

Levia notices a guard watching us and attempts to play Rock Paper Scissors
- "Kobold with hitler-stache" told to watch us by Yuurja
- Name is Wally


"Short figure", dwarf standing with a spyglass
Erris goes invisible, flies up to him
Black hair in a ponytail, eye paint, thin beard

Pulls out a red note
"Take this. Go to Miss Lydia, she wishes to have an audience with you."

He jumps away into a really stinky apartment, smells of rot and decay, ransacked bed, splattered porridge
Meth wallruns to meet up, rest of the party walks over
No doorway into this apartment
Black mold everywhere, orange slime
Mold is not an illusion
Corner of bed cover does not look like rest of the room. Revealed that there is no bed, it is a wooden brace with a secret door down to a ladder 

Party walks over, runs into a thin orog at the front door
- They enter from the ground

Meth + Erris go down ladder, find very small room. Door opens to hallway

Note just has a symbol of an eye with an "angry eyebrow"
Random kobold lighting a cigar, recognizes symbol as Lydia's House of Mounts (stable lookin building)

We show up to House of Mounts
- They need tickets, they take the red piece of paper for entry
- Orog guy is guiding us
- Wooden structure for gambling?
- Central building looks Greco-Roman, like "generic DC building"
	- It's another "bustling saloon"
- Lydia has her own guards corps, but they're not "official" and look militia/scuffed. Also diverse

### Lydia
We enter Lydia's office
- Nice looking, if old. Crescent-shaped table
- "Emperor Palpatine" style chair, boots up
- Orog/Orc – Pretty, hair in bun, clothes pressed, black lipstick, eyepatch. 
- Undead IN THE COUCHES
	- They are apparently remnants of Orog civilization

She asks us about Orog horde
She asks us why "Painted dragonborn" would show up
- Doesn't believe that real gold exists\
- Presence of gold dragonborn means either Meth is a distant relative of the Paragon, or he is offspring
She invites us to a contest – rare creatures out on the prairie. 
- Payout: 3 emerald scales, 1 ruby
	- 1 emerald = 1 month's residency at a good inn for the whole party
- Negotiates up to 6 emerald, 6 sapphire + 1 ruby for 2 extra rounds
