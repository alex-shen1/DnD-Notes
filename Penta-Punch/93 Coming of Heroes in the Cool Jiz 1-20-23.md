A year since the Red Hand horde defeated

Celebration for us on the 13th of Nidal, reunion

Rene, Tigre, Meth signed us up for a fighting tournament — “greatest the Sword Coast has to offer”

Penta-Punch’s house is known as the Big PP House

Wood floors, stone walls, simple candlelight’

  

## Penta-Punch updates:

Meth has a small dent in his chest, and got a Penta-Punch tattoo

Levia is glowing and has a new arm??? One arm is constructed out of greenery

They give me a Staff of Power

Rene has a recurring dream where she wakes up in an unrecognizable place that explodes

Erris has claimed the nicest room (the attic) for himself 🙂

Lio doesn’t like sleeping alone and is traumatized

  

## The City

Things really ramping up towards celebrations

Coinlords have built up Coinlord’s Column — new district

Coinlords want to build a highway to the Sword Coast

Lio and Meth 3rd floor, Rene and Levia get the 2nd floor

  

Revisit Evereska w/ Meth

Barlax can be freed with overwhelming magic, may have insights into Meth’s parentage

Do a shitload of communes; Nyvorlas/Nasiri not yet canon, Erris’ letter has been received, Ant has defeated Urikel Zarel, etc. etc.

  

## The Festival

Dagger throwing game — Erris subtle spells Telekinesis and wins a Gobblock figure from a fair game, Rene grabs it and destroys it in front of a kid, traumatizing her

  

Pie eating contest — Levia vs. Rima vs. Immerstal vs. Shining Axe vs. randoms

Levia canonically allergic to roudaberries

Erris attempts to Guidance Rima but she fails immediately lol

Levia passes out, losing to the dwarf (Obek)

  

Jaarmath gives a speech; Erris gives a similar speech to lukewarm reception

Fireball in the air to celebrate

  

We spend New Year’s in Talar, then warp to Phandalin and wind walk to Neverwinter on the 5th

  

## The Tournament of the Century

We’re here for the Tournament of the Century — all internal bridges are unlocked

Venue is a colosseum called the Kolijez

  

There’s a team called the Ball Crushers

Randall and the Stags

Vulture wing-themed teams

Cup with daggers?

Pirates of Morkhulmber (?)

Swansong

Hungry Cows

  

Levia claims we’re the Pirates of Morkhulmber, we get money thrown at us lol

49 teams total

  

## Preliminary

Guy in front of us: looks like Vegeta, has Darth Maul-esque tattoos

Vengervar of the **Ebon Tops**

**Harpo** — organizer of the tournament with his 8 brothers

Erris insults him, and we fight a duel

They get absolutely swagged on

Their life force is linked; if one dies they all do

They warn us about the Fellowship of the Duck

  

As we leave, we encounter a tiefling wearing a straw hat eating straw

We get blue bracelets indicating participation in the tournament

We’re recommended to stay at the Fallen Tower

## The Broken Tower

Costs 2 gp per day (discounted to 8 sp per day because we’re contestants)

We meet **Randall and the Stags**

Randall (half-orc) is dramatic, proclaims us rivals

Has “oily biceps”

The stags: “zoomer haircut”, all refer to him as “hottest guy in the world”

Muscles are smaller than Meth’s; no battle scars

  

Random people with metal drill bits on their heads?

We get confronted by **Punch** — group is **One Punch**, but they were too big and split

We meet **Sentis**, another organizer who looks exactly like Harpo

  

Challenge is to open a door

Hween (?)

  

Hint: “hug the right wall”
