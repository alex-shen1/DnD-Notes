## Phylactery Yikes

Rene wants to attune to the phylactery

Asks via Commune first:

- Is Speaker Rolo alive? → Unclear
- If I attune to the phylactery, could I lose my autonomy? → Unclear
- Is the bulk of the Red Hand army within 36 hours of arriving at Talar? → No

Ilian Snowmantle has a blade made of similar material to the chain (adamantine)

- Just the material on the chain is worth 1000 gp or more
- Actual totem itself doesn’t have fungus growth linked to Zuggtmoy, but

“This is a violent attunement”

- Aspects of the soul will attempt to enforce themselves on Rene
- DC 17 WIS save → RIP
- Action to finish attuning to use in Rune of Grehik

## Return of Hoid and Golos

- Hoid and Golos return with Immerstal!
- Hoid is missing a middle finger; Mindbender is a spellcaster with fanatics that took his hand
    - Losing fingers mean losing levels of spells
- Golos is still missing an arm, has a caved-in chest cavity
- Hoid has a blinking charm detecting _something_ on Rene

## Scouting

- Rene and Ant go on Bolt while the rest helps with construction/training
- Nimon’s gap bridge has been rebuilt with components from the house
- Army spread apart on both sides of the bridge
- They’re spotted
- Successfully fireball and then almost make it away
- Big bugbear (Karn?) yeets a huge wooden thing at them, but it does nothing lmao
- Roughly 7000 people

## Dawn of the 12th

- More reinforcements
- Owlbears and elves come in!
- Meet an extremely old guy, balding half-elf → Ilian Snowmantle
    - Has a scimitar/staff
    - 200 years old, exceptionally old for a half elf
- Nyvorlas and Nasiri are further apart 😟

## Dawn of the 13th

- One of the Black Knives reports that there is smoke on the horizon :/
- Jilek challenges us, “demanding satisfaction” for taking his kill
    - Levia “loses”

## Dawn of the 14th

- Another war council 😕
- Immerstal can summon a big ooze once to dissolve weapons
- Gonna strike tonight!

# The Siege Begins

- Centaur-like creature with devil horns, shoulder spikes, horned tail comes up to the gate holding a white flag
    
    - Levia recognizes it as a demonic creature
    - Rene knows it is an **Armanite** — demon cavalry

- Ulverth asks us to open the gates, we go out as representatives
- “Behind me are the forces of Azarr Kul, protector of this land”

Rene and Meth fly up with Bolt, easily wreck them
