Recap: Michael

Retcon: took an extra day, but found an ad for **Bazaar of the Bizarre**

Magic fog over the city

Signs of stuff collapsing from above

Purple glow in windows

Start on an outcrop over the city; gradually climb down and enter here

![[Untitled 54.png|Untitled 54.png]]

Every building is made from manastone, and a lot of it

Mist seems to be some kind of fungal spore?

- “Fuzzy mold” growing around

Magic color changes in this area (!!)

- Fungi changes the color
- Light → black light
- Erris’ purple flame is now gold
- Nali’s flame is now blue

  

Follow the left wall from the entrypoint

### First District

- Apperars to be residential
- Stained glass windows shattered
    - Very old; other signs of decay
- Feels like there’s something watching us from inside the homes
    - “Squat creature with single large eye”
    - Do NOT look like goblins

Son recalls a story from Grandad: he was in the TIA investigating creatures that had appeared called **nothics —** ordinary humanoids corrupted by magic, can live extremely long lives

See some white-domed building?

Head towards central spire first though

Run into Rene and Levia!

- They’re fighting a “Living Bigby’s Hand”

  

Apparently Levia and Rene have befriended (a simulacrum of) **Caksde**

- Brought him back to life

![[Untitled 1 34.png|Untitled 1 34.png]]

- construct is a “magimation” (?)
- Was a rival with Bynaus Vmere; “he would have put it more strongly”
    - “His vacuum cleaner did kinda suck”
    - He has a “prism” inside his head where a brain would be
    - Rene and Levia built/stole a body for him

Rene and Levia need to destroy the “Heart of Palter” in the next 7 days or they die

- They’ve been “cursed”
- They made a deal with some “weird god” Nethys after they got stuck “inbetween life and death”
- “Heart of Palter” = Palterian Mythallar is in the big tower in the center of the city
    - Suspect that it’s already destroyed
    - But it should’ve released a lot of energy, enough to destroy the city when destroyed
- Suspect that **Stismareth** is alive and working with the Ninfang to build robots
    - Robots originally designed by Caksde
- Encountered “some orc” who’s a very powerful spellcaster; dead now
    - Brugo’s Spellbook — made from trillimac (Underdark fungus)
    - Harvested from Drow; very expensive material that signifies wealth

Nethys gave the statue (**Netherese Titan**) to the Palterians; it destroyed the city

  

As we discuss, we hear thumping nearby → keep moving

  

Move to “quidditch arena”

- Three staff things emitting electrical fields

  

Robotic voice commands us to freeze

On the orders of Maegona (?) and Ninfang you are ordered to surrender

- Get attacked by a flesh thing and 2 Miskakan Series 1s
- They are noticeably shittier than the one we fought in Bynaus’ lab

Bynaus Vmere projection can simply disable any Miskakan Series 1 with the cost of a level 2 slot

“Chain Lightning” is a sport around here

  

Sit down and talk

- Ask Caksde about stuff
    - “Wasn’t accepted” by the broader community
    - Currently in the military quarter; he doesn’t know about militarized stuff
    - Bazaar is “one subcircle” away — just past arboretum
        - Arboretum is where the wands would be made
    - “Castle thing” is a library
- Conjuration magic doesn’t work here

  

Investigate a building with a red glow

- Has some kind of portcullis — it’s the prison
- “Floor cleaner bandit” ???

Still being watched — detect magic senses “tainted wild magic”; lots of abjuration magic on the portcullis

  

Karsus built an obelisk “failsafe”, “something to do with time”

Having a staff of power → you can turn back time

Turns out they only have 2 days

  

We randomly find **Xorannox** (the Palterian beholder we fought) killed in the square

- Signs of battle; crates of weapons nearby

  

### Arboretum

- “Tree is not right”
- “Cruel and angry” face in the tree
- Meth tries to talk to the tree
    - Wind moves through the grove
- Levia attempts Remove Curse → “spiderwebs” of brighter roots grow until the whole tree is bright
    - Wind says “thank you”
- We leave lmao

### Library

No windows, we climb a lot of stairs

Caksde takes Meth and Erris off to look at magimation books

- He worked under Master Eranti (??); got kicked out for not being a good mage
- Doesn’t know what ki is
- Run into a “bespectacled jackal-headed creature” and an “eyeless, white 5’ penguin in a harness” (Kingsport)
    - Speaks broken common
    - Scribbenscry (??)
    - Erris identifies creature as **arcanoloth; kingsport is a giant albino penguin**
        
        ![[Untitled 2 21.png|Untitled 2 21.png]]
        
        ![[Untitled 3 13.png|Untitled 3 13.png]]
        
    - Books of keeping
        - Signalling that we don’t know what they are sets him off
        - Titled “Books of Keeping 1-4”
    - They have a master-servant relationship

Levia looks for books on war/god: sees creature tearing apart books

![[Untitled 4 8.png|Untitled 4 8.png]]

Lio looks for druidic books

  

Erris leads the arcanoloth back to the party

Eventually he catches on and plane shifts away after we attempt to slow/hold monster

- Penguin says “NOO HELP ME”
- Cart also vanishes

Rene attempts a commune → divine magic in Palter omegalul

- CHA check → passes
- Is Calybrizax in central palter? → unclear

Encounter a square → Netherese titan and other dudes

**Jorys the Footcarver —** speaking with the titan, giving it commands?

![[Untitled 5 7.png|Untitled 5 7.png]]

Pedestal of the Netherese Titan is here…

![[Untitled 6 6.png|Untitled 6 6.png]]

Massive prep only to immediately flunk our initiative rolls

Erris bad tactical advice — Granddad

Letza INCREDIBLE

  

Dazran summons a bone devil (??)

- Self-describes as “Most fortified of Myrkul’s servants”
- “You won’t be able to kill me… only those touched by death can”

Kill the other guys, Titan doesn’t seem to actively attack us; shoves rocks into its body to heal

- Seems to be guarding the platform it’s standing on; always goes back

nvm bro jumps on us and deals 24d10/10d10

- Grandad rezzed to immediately get killed again
