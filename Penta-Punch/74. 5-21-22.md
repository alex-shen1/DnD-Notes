## Evening

- We open after taking over the monastery, resting before we head out tomorrow for Rhest
- Erris reading his old book
- Book \#1: History of elves as a species, independent of religious dogma
    - Elves are descendants of Eladrin (used to be called elves, but now separate species)
        - Levia looks like one!
    - Before that, long-lived race called Tel-Quessir that looked like statues (?)
    - Most recent history is 5-6000 years ago — refers to a famous event resulting in the declining of the elvish population that we’re supposed to know, but don’t
    - Others: queens seem more like Tel-Quessir than elves (tall, old)
    - Authors speculate that elves morphed out of trees/other nature?
        - Also xenophobic against tieflings
- Rene’s atropal heart wants to hear about Levia
    - Rene tells it about how she transforms, successfully abating the voice
- Meth is gonna dad at the grocery them
- Rene goes into Tigre’s dreamland

  

## Departure

- Meth leaves the trainees in Assedroh’s care, we fly off to Rhest
- Both eagles see a fight happening near the lake
    
    - 2 ogres with goblins in a rig on its back?
    - Red Hand soldiers surrounding a mounted owlbear
    - Red drake (young dragon)
    - They’re cornering an owlbear
        - Dead person on an owlbear
    - Tigre fights the drake midair while we fight on the ground
    
      
    
- Two unconscious young (20s?) elves died, Erris brought them back
    
    - Boy has harness (owlbear guy)
        - Dark brown hair, dreadlocks?
        - Fair-skinned with facial scars

        ![[Untitled 1 12.png|Untitled 1 12.png]]
        
- Investigating the drake:
    - Drake is young, wings shouldn’t be that big (artificial growth)
    - Words carved into its skin with Infernal

  

## The Camp

- Erris convinces Nasiri to let the party join them at their camp but leaves us alone
- Tigre convinces the owlbear guy (Nyvorlas) to transform back into an elf
    - He can’t turn into anything except an owlbear
    - He’s very xenophobic
- They’re Tiri Kitor!
- They don’t want to go back to Evereska, don’t want to be involved in politics
    - In fact, they’ve sworn to not return
    - Fighting the Red Hand because they’re “burning the land”
- Nasiri has parent issues?
- Talking to Nyvorlas (a bit of a blabbermouth):
    - They’re always on the move
    - References characters:
        - “Speaker Snowmantle” (?)
        - Ildred (?)
        - Trelara (some kind of librarian?)
        - Kadu (his brother?)
    - His favorite book is _1084_
    - Down bad for Nasiri
- Tigre learns to transform into a black shell snail
    - Completes the quest and just gets a jade/silver circlet in the mud??
    - It’s not magical, but resembles dwarven artwork in Evereska
    - Probably from Rhest

## Rhest

- They escort us to the outskirts of Rhest and tell us to cross the bridge
- We travel “underwater” with reeds instead of taking the bridge
- ~2 mile lake has formed with most of the city submerged
- 2 main buildings over the flooded area
    - Stone tower quarter mile from shore where we are
    - Large stone building near the lake center
    - Rickety floating wooden walkways built recently
- We hear chittering around us, maybe some torchlight
    
    - Something surrounding us?
    - We get ambushed by lizardfolk!
