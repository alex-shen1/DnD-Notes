## In the Air

- Open the session in the air; Rene as the only flier
- Ant canonically speaks like the BitConnect guy
- Atropal heart (in Lio’s voice) tells Rene that something attempted to watch us but failed
- Greycloak Hills seemingly magical

## Talar

- Basin of the nearby watershed — lowest elevation
- Small homesteads/farms surrounding the city, which is rather well-populated
- Rene senses ozone; half-orc stands floating before us in the air
    
    ![[Untitled 26.png|Untitled 26.png]]
    
    - Appears to be an illusion; gestures to the ground and vanishes
- Not much war yet, but commoners/soldiers have begun building fortifications

![[Untitled 1 17.png|Untitled 1 17.png]]

- Rene flying down to the South Gate, but get blasted by a wizard tower on the way
    - Rene gets paralyzed; we all drop
- Orc guy flies out to us, introduces himself as **Immerstal The Red, Resident Mage of Talar**
    - They are aware of the destruction of Drellin’s Ferry
    - Tell him we’re here about the Red Hand; he agrees to take us to **Lord Kerden Jaarmath**
    - He charges us 4 gp as a fine for standing on the grass
        - “Not Waterdhavian” (?)
    - Surprised we know of Evereska; deflects when asked
        - Insight check — he’s worried he’ll give away more information than he should
- Some buildings have their windows boarded up
    - Human guards have Lions emblazoned on them (note: Lion Guard served Queen of Extol)
    - Lord’s keep is not as old as Evereska
    - 8 paintings depicting former lords (they’ve been here for 80 generations?)
    - One of the recent ones depicts a lord holding a lizardfolk’s body
- We’re taken to a room super long table (the lord’s hall?)
    
    ![[Untitled 6.png|Untitled 6.png]]
    
    - Turns out we crashed into his garden lmao
    - Short guy, middle-aged, carries a rapier
    - He invites us to the war council, against Immerstal’s protests

## The War Council

- We go to a cathedral for sun god **Pelor**
- Council members:
    - Jaarmath and Immerstal
    - **Captain Ulverth —** leader of militia?
        
        - Developing a military plan
        - City has ~1000 fighters (militiamen, clerics, etc.) + 100 elite Lions of Talar
        - Preparing for siege — traps, etc.
        
        ![[Untitled 2 10.png|Untitled 2 10.png]]
        
    - **Tredora Goldenbrow** — aasimar head priest of Pelor
        
        - Agrees w/ Lady Kaal’s proposal
        
        ![[Untitled 3 6.png|Untitled 3 6.png]]
        
    - **Lady Amerras Kaal —** evacuating “highest risk individuals” into Talar taverns
        
        - “Technically of house Kaal” but banished for being not pureblooded enough
        - Proposes we evacuate some to Evereska — we will talk to Queens about it
            - She wants us to ask why their bargemen have vanished
            - Evereska normally sends barges for supplies every 20 days, but the recent one didn’t
            - Council agrees to proposal
        - Leads a strike force named The Black Knives
        
        ![[Untitled 4 2.png|Untitled 4 2.png]]
        
- Survivor of the attack on Drellin’s Ferry
    - Red dragon attacked them, but had green flame so not Abythriax
- Immerstal’s predecessor was Lord Jaarmath’s late father
    - Says Tredora’s first name — maybe a personal connection
    - Uses her last name when she expresses agreement with the Evereska plan
- Jaarmath and Goldenbrow voted against the bridge explosion plan; everyone else disagrees
    - We get a signed note from Jaarmath

## Immerstal’s Tower

- Immerstal was apprentice of a Red Wizard of Thay and stole his scrolls
    - Scroll of Thay made of dragonborn skin
    - “Advance in a different direction than lichdom”
        - Enhance spell duration → attempt to extend Clone indefinitely
- He makes potions, but specializes in conjuration
- He offers inks + potion of flying to us
- He links his mind to us
    - He used to adventure with the lord’s dad

## The Walk

- Ant took out the Master of Locust
- We encounter a broken carriage → combat!
    - New enemy type: **Red Hand Goblock**
        
        ![[Untitled 5 2.png|Untitled 5 2.png]]
        
    - Erris saves Ant’s life from Finger of Death and then proceeds to Fire Bolt only
- Instructed to look for Penta-Punch, signed by Supreme Goblock
- We tell Immerstal about this but he already knows there have been some in the area and the Northdark Moor
    - **Skather** is leading them — probably the identity of the Supreme Goblock

## Arrival in Nimon’s Gap

![[Untitled 6 2.png|Untitled 6 2.png]]

- Immerstal uses Sending to contact a local
    - Old guy “Austi” meets us on the bridge
    - Proprietor of the Cross-Eyed Beholder, and town master
    - “The bridge is a sign of our resilience”
    - Has a son named Nimon (the bridge is also called Nimon’s Bridge)
    - Was married on the bridge, but she died
    - He also has Alzheimer’s
- We gather at the tavern
    - They give us free food!
        - Cups are carved by Austi’s late wife Nimon; handles are in shape of a bridge
    - “Nimon’s Prophecy”— one day someone will come with bad news and they will do something to the bridge; those people are actually villains
    - Founder of the town is Charles
        - Carlos (his brother) built the bridge
        - Nimon was a children’s toy that the brothers liked

## Ozzyrandion

- We go to sleep and wake up to this lady

![[Untitled 7 2.png|Untitled 7 2.png]]

- Almost as tall as Meth, but his horn is bigger
    - Ozzyrandion!
    - Fiend, green dragon
    - And she’s not an illusion
    - **Tyrgarun** (”the blue”) is probably the one who spied on Rene
    - Galanthrax and Xaersoissurth were her brothers
    - Wants to join us because she thinks they’re losing
    - Knows Mind Blank
    - The medallion is embedded deep inside her heart
    - Much older than brothers
- The Red Hand believes the following:
    - Meth is thinker
    - Ant is Lio, Innil’s brother
        - She thinks Ant is one of his other personalities
    - Rene is singer
    - Erris is the angry one
    - Levia is “powerful flying mage”

## Surgical Plan

- Dragon slayer sword to remove scales — Levia
- Pull the flesh flaps apart to reveal the inner area — Levia + Meth
- Normal blade to make the incision — Ant
- Remove Curse on Ozzyrandion’s attunement to the medallion — Levia
- Yank it out — Meth

## Doing the Surgery

- We go to a clearing outside town
- She morphs into a large green dragon — significantly larger than Galanthrax
    - “At least an adult”
- She mentions being the Destroyer of the **Summer Court**?
    - Erris Arcana check: Fey thing?
- AC < 20
- Levia fails two Remove Curses, Erris uses Dispel Magic
- Meth failing Athletics rolls like crazy
- Erris blow up the medallion and it does 49 damage 😕

## New Information

- Red Hand is spying on us via Tyrgarun
- Amulets within them can detonate; others can detonate them on purpose
    - Plan is to use medals to blow up Evereska after we foiled the Behir Sand
- Behir Sand comes from Behirs
    - Varanthion is a dragon-friendly behir who works with Ulwai
- Only Tyrgarun (adult blue dragon, divination master), Abythriax, Azarr Kul, Queen of the Hunt
    - Erris and Ant realize the truth about the queen; others don’t
    - Queen engineered the ritual to insert the talismans; “knows things that she should not”
    - Tyrgarun and Abythriax are in the Fane of Melthuzac, doesn’t know where it is
        - Somewhere in the Greycloak Hills
- Confirmed “Ghostlord” is the lich; marked his lair on our map
    - She helped them steal the phylactery
    - He’s insane and will likely not do deals
    - Destroying the phylactery would probably kill the lich
    - You would need legendary-level power to destroy a phylactery
    - Undead army 100-200
        - **Boneclaws** (wizards who attempt lichdom and fail, or very powerful undead tied to the phylactery of another lich)
- She’s from the Feywild; no liches
    - The medal itself turns people into fiends
- Offers to help us fight Abythriax
    - Abythriax is the one who recruited her with a “greater purpose” — took her brothers and knows the spell that requires the talisman
    - He hates this place and has a “grander plan”
    - We’re probably gonna fight Abythriax and Tyrgarun at the same time
- Azarr Kul is a gold dragonborn!
    - Half-bugbear, half dragonborn
    - Only one true gold dragon (king of all dragons) — “Paragon of Draconia”
    - Cleric of Melthuzac
- Rumor that Melthuzac is the son of Tiamat and Bahamut
    - Considered a Colossal (Cabal)
- She’s the one who attacked Drellin’s Ferry disguised as an ancient red dragon
- Queen of Extol’s champion (Halar Starshatter) isn’t dead
    - Location unknown
- Wants to return home to the Feywild via Banishment after all this is done
    - Meth is very sus of letting her go home
    - Time works differently in other planes so letting her go for even a moment could be an eternity there
- Worked for the Red Hand for 40 years
- Army size ~7000 at _most_
- She gives us a black/green gem to attune to to contact her
    - 50 words or less

## Downtime

- They contact Tomer idk
- Contact Rene
    - Refugees are being dropped off in Talar yikes
    - But Triam has a key so they could get back
- Erris finishes copying the spell but doesn’t have material components ☹️
- Rene gets a vision from the atropal heart of the “secret of Evereska”
    - Sun god (Amaunator/Lathander/Pelor)
    - Golden lady (Tymora)
    - Oghma (head looks like Lovecraftian horror)
    - Gods are fighting a very powerful formless being and losing
        - Fight is happening over something?
        - Some being — the very atropal telling the story
    - Beyond planar barrier, more fighting
        - Fey-like being called The Sea and Melthuzac (chaotic beings) fighting against gods
    - Tymora crashes; Oghma attempts to help while sun god strikes down atropal instead of letting enemies have it
        - “Realmic barrier breaks”, the sea floods into Material Plane as the same time as Melthuzac
        - The Sea is restrained; Melthuzac vanishes leaving behind a claw sinking into the valley of Evereska (Large black stone)
            - Mind, soul, and body of The Sea split into the 3 queens of Evereska
                - Extol: mind
                - Partition: body
                - Hunt: emotions
        - Atropal buried by the gods; life comes to Toril
        - Neimotoidal paracosal (???) assault Material Plane, killing another god
        - Gods come together and think the place is cursed, so they lock up all their bad shit here
            - Make it home of elves/dwarves → dwarves arrive first, carve the city, but leave it
            - Elves arrive after abandonment and find the 3 queens
            - Dwarvish/elvish poets write about progress over 3000 years
        - 50,000 years prior, gods came to check and The Sea reformed
            - Body of The Sea locked below the waters of the city itself; Queen of Partition is “least there”?
                - Suffers from brief flashbacks
                - Other queens have completely forgotten
    - The Weave Barrier was established to block Urikel Zarl; blocks even memory outside
