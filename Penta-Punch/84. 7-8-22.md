- Pyramid is weird, timeshift-y (pieces look good one second then broken the next)
- Ant tries to darkness to steal the phylactery as
    - Claims we’re in the Tiri Kitor lol
- Toss some sand on some shifting stone, but then it changes entirely

## Entering the Dungeon

- DC 25 wisdom save to see that we’re in a fake dungeon, Levia passes thanks to 24 + 1 lmao
- We come out to see Siegfried, in an entryway to a tomb
    - He welcomes us to the Mausoleum of Urikel Zarl, Emperor of the Separated Lands
    - It took brigands “2 minutes” to get through “the trial”
    - He wants to confiscate our weapons; piercing weapons are stabbed directly into him
- He’s showing us around as if everything is still intact when it’s not lol
- Ghouls are eating rocks covered in fuzzy fungi, growing mushrooms on his body
    - Spores are magically controlling something
- Shrine to ??? who “brigands” defaced to steal the phylactery
    - It’s now the 8th! (8 days fastforward)
- Time isn’t accelerating, but variable — Siegfried slows down time for us

## The Ghostlord

![[Untitled 30.png|Untitled 30.png]]

- His body seems to be mostly conjured plants; only the head is corporeal
- He offers us Blessing of Zuggtmoy
    - Zuggtmoy is an evil demonic deity, worshipped by some lizardfolk
    - Lady of Rot and Decay, Demon Queen of Fungi
    - Blessing makes them sporelings
    - Ant takes it yikes
- He wants revenge on Elsir Vale and Draconia
- He was making the storm and stopped it

## Return to Talar

- We emerge on the night of the 9th
- Siegfried has a flying cloak (speed of 45)
- Retcon: Hoid gave us a message a while ago
    - Sending to him: Repeat message. Are you safe. Been out of the loop for a week. Sit rep needed.
    - Response: Rene What The Fuck Weave Barrrier Gone, Tirklasthe Flying, Queens unreachable, Lockdown in city, I think queens involved in red hand. Mindbender has taken asylum
    - Sending to Rene: Golos and I are hiding, have hidden in refugee camp (long story) Dont drink the blue stuff. Where are you? I everyone ok?
    - Response: No clue about redhand or queens- thought you would know. We might get out of dodge by teleporting to calmishan. This place is fucked.
- We pass over the Khasazahd Bridge (the one Ozzyrandion was holding)
- Nimon’s Gap is burning
