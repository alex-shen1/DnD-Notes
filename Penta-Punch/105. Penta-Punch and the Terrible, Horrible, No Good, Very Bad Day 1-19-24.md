Patrick recap

Open around the shard of metal that dissolved

  

Antimagic metal thing had the same symbol carved all over it

- Experiments on metal dust→ lost its properties after destruction
- Very brittle

  

Climb an ice wall; Erris has a skill issue

Encounter a camp of 3 people wearing skins of huge canines

- Some guy asks us if we’re there on “Ninfang”’s orders
- Warns us to not go north
    - Insight check reveals that he has ulterior motives
    - They have “tools/weapons” (definitely weapons) on them
- We decide to just go around them

  

Some animal (rabbit raccoons) following us — they’re magical, so SUPPOSEDLY druids wouldn’t be able to transform into them

  

We find a huge statue and someone making a rubbing of the symbols it contains

We found Letza!

![[Untitled 50.png|Untitled 50.png]]

Even she doesn’t know who Ninfang is

She has a lot of notes on finding stuff, claw marks in the ground, dragon droppings

She’s looking for her (draconic) ancestor to open the Thunderclaw Way and to “understand why the Tower Dragon vanished” — Tower Dragon _is_ Dragon Lord Calibrizax, who’s gone missing

Searched the Anauroch but didn’t find anything there

She says you’d have to have draconic ancestry to open the Thunderclaw Way; looks intently at Levia/Meth

She asks if Meth has a “true name”

Azarr Kul came, claiming to be sired by the Paragon and they didn’t believe him

Paragon used magic to create Draconia in the Crag of Eons

Vaasa _was_ the lands where Draconia now is → could

  

We help her in exchange for assistance on our quest

- Area appears to be the site of a fight between Calibrizax and some enemies, but no corpses
- Statue made by the Netherese
    - Enscribed sigil in it, metalish (same kind of material as the antimagic thing)
    - Sigils look different

- As we get close to the statue, weird “bodies” start teleporting in

Casters recognize them as magically-imbued creatures

Rene knocks on the statue thing; seems like the statue is only partially made of the material

Netherese Absorbers completely immune to necrotic/radiant

Nullifier immune to radiant

24 wolves omegalul

Statue wakes up!

Immediately kills all the enemies

Levia jumps on the blade

Rene attempts to Greater Restoration; completely useless and takes 40 _necrotic_ damage

“Kill me in my home to damage me if all else fails”

It retrieves the blade (with Levia still on it), absorbs her and falls into the ground

Rene, Levia, and the titan fall into a huge hole

![[Untitled 6 4.png|Untitled 6 4.png]]

Erris flies over the hole; at least 200 ft deep, much more

  

Erris posit - Maybe Calibrizax _is_ the titan?

Ninfang in some kind of conflict with Calibrizax

Letza thinks this area is a fallen Netherese city, knows of some excavation site 3 hours away

Random outpost camp is an hour back, but they probably moved by now

  

We set off, led by Lio

We’re currently very high up; totally room for a buried city below us

Find another camp!

2 people, someone and their grandpa→ Letza thinks it’s Ninfang??

- They seem to be bickering a lot
- Tortles!
- There’s a “dad” turtle who may know about the dig site

  

Ninfang is a group
