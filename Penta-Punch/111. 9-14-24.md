Retcons from last session:

### Fight Aftermath
Inspiration: reroll 3 points

Letza, rewound 2 hours, comes to, sees ancestor's body, vomits from "time sickness"
Mythallar light fades

Nali thinks it's Might and vomits on Meth
- "I'll have you know, I'm married" -Meth

Granddad is a full foot taller and JACKED, "perfect physical specimen"
- Fresh tattoos


Mythallar is joever; we've eliminated "the heart of Palter"

Lio recognizes symptoms of temporal sickness in the people who got healed by the Grehik runes
- They didn't heal, they are old selves that were moved through time
- They are expected to feel better soon

Granddad's name just _is_ granddad
- His family has prophesized the coming of Son and Dad

Loot Maegona's humanoid body
- Crumpled note written in Common: checkmarks
	- Shopping list of lich ritual ingredients
	- One way someone could ascend; other ways
	- Some are extremely expensive and hard to come by
		- She did trials before
- Spectral look to her face has vanished, she's humanoid but the energy has been drained by the ritual
- Ritual dagger
- Spellbook
	- Had more spells at some point, but removed to make a specifically lethal set of spells.
	- Finger-sized
	- Eldritch Blast, Inflict Wounds, Blindness/Deafness, Counterspell, Vitriolic Sphere, Hold Monster, Disintegrate, Finger of Death, Abid-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting
	- Was working on writing another spell, researching to creating her own 9th level spell relating to replication? Infant intestines?

Lich's energy absorbed into the mythallar, no phylactery

Caksde, Son, and Granddad join up to adventure together

Letza offers us help with Draconia (where she was born), make introductions
- Offers to teach Meth "dragon-style techniques"
- Mentions we can find diamonds in the town of **Chenfels**
	- In the yellow dragon territories

Area is getting darker and darker â€“ Palter lights are dimming

We send them back to Palter

Rest in the grove without doing anything else
- Meth goes to grove
- "Thank you. You've freed us. Soon all souls will leave this place"

Nali has been mega downgraded, doesn't trust us very much

Teleport back to Myth Ondath
### The Return
Camp is gone, likely because we opened the way?
Go back to the monastery itself\

Someone is pulling at a cart, but suspiciously?
- As if they're waiting for us
- Erris flies above
- Warplady Levia! And Ant!
	- Ant has grown a beard, hair's gotten blacker, slightly warped
	- No longer wearing an eyepatch
	- She calls him Vulmer 
	- ![[Pasted image 20240914223141.png]]
- Vulmer: "I'm no longer interested in your contract. I no longer need the body. But this one (points to Warplady Levia) here really wants all of you captured"
	- Brother is "still in recovery"
	- Offers aid for a lock of hair, blood, and spit from Lio
Erris attacks Ant/Vulmer immediately
WTF IS KLINKY
- "Merrenoloth"

Thayan archmage says "Remember what you promised me. The boy. Alive"
- Boy. You are Thayan property
