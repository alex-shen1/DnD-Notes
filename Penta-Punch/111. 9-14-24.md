Retcons from last session:

### Fight Aftermath
Inspiration: reroll 3 points

Letza, rewound 2 hours, comes to, sees ancestor's body, vomits from "time sickness"
Mythallar light fades

Nali thinks it's Might and vomits on Meth
- "I'll have you know, I'm married" -Meth

Granddad is a full foot taller and JACKED, "perfect physical specimen"
- Fresh tattoos


Mythallar is joever; we've eliminated "the heart of Palter"

Lio recognizes symptoms of temporal sickness in the people who got healed by the Grehik runes
- They didn't heal, they are old selves that were moved through time
- They are expected to feel better soon

Granddad's name just _is_ granddad
- His family has prophesized the coming of Son and Dad

Loot Maegona's humanoid body
- Crumpled note written in Common: checkmarks
	- Shopping list of lich ritual ingredients
	- One way someone could ascend; other ways
	- Some are extremely expensive and hard to come by
		- She did trials before
- Spectral look to her face has vanished, she's humanoid but the energy has been drained by the ritual
- Ritual dagger
- Spellbook
	- Had more spells at some point, but removed to make a specifically lethal set of spells.
	- Finger-sized
	- Eldritch Blast, Inflict Wounds, Blindness/Deafness, Counterspell, Vitriolic Sphere, Hold Monster, Disintegrate, Finger of Death, Abid-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting
	- Was working on writing another spell, researching to creating her own 9th level spell relating to replication? Infant intestines?

Lich's energy absorbed into the mythallar, no phylactery
