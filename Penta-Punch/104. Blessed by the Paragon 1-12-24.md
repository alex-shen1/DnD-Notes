Michael did the recap

Levia dream sequence

- Levia dreams of her home city Luxora under attack
- Sees Warplady Levia → the dream is her memories
- Bad stuff happened
- She killed Sun Tree aspect of Amaunator and the rest of Penta-Punch

Erris dream sequence

- Back at the Talaje with Rima, but I know it’s a dream
- She starts dying before me
- Notice Levia asleep on the ground

We wake up

  

Some monk comes looking for Rene and Meth, invites all of us

- Master Harrrass greets us AND appears more respectful than before
- Appears to have been affected by Rene’s dream shenanigans
- He brings a glass bottle with green liquid containing an eyeball
    - It’s a device used for dowsing
    - Eye is a hag’s eye
    - Letza gave it to him for emergencies to find her (body)
    - One of her scales is dissolved in the liquid so it’s attuned to her
- She’s going to a Netherese city
    - Some believe all modern humans are descended from the Netherese
    - Netherese society was a magocracy
    - Dark hair are Netherese; light hair not?
    - Their cities crashed in Icewind Dale and the Anauroch after the Spellplague

  

Decide to try opening the door before

Megaluck → door opens

  

Finally set off through desert

8 “standing stones” (?)

- “Vaguely Thayan”
- Detect transmutation magic
- ~30 ft radius circle
- This was once wood/granite, transmuted to “stone-like” material
    - Each of them is hollow!?
    - Material is squishy

We skip it; Rene uses Dream on Harrrass again

Fly over the High Ice

See people on the ground moving in the same direction

We get hit with antimagic from this random piece of metal sticking in the ground → wind walk ends, as well as any attunements + buffs

Fight some Remorhaz

Lots of antimagic all around
