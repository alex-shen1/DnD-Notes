We get attacked

- Attackers (Zivarroo/Welgaaden) have golden collars and floating stones
- “For Baron Kalyos (??)
- “Focus on our targets” — we don’t know who the targets are lol
- Flying gem around Welgaaden dissipates (?); other starts glowing
    - The gems are absorbing damage!
    - Welgaaden is a fiend; Zivarroo isn’t
- Some NPC from the street attacks them; manages to break the gem (”warp armor”) but gets immediately killed

We win, but Rima and Immerstal suggest we leave ASAP to avoid further conflict

- Hoid bet: Tigre can redesign his Magnificent Mansion for the rest of his life if he gets captured before the next time we meet

Hoid’s old place is built on a desecrated shrine to **Verenestra** (?) patron demigod of dryads

Way to vault is led to be cairns (?); bypass defenses by saying “Hushpuppy”

New lore!

- New armor shop called Ironclad Armory in the Southern Quarter
- Nali sought power to defeat the Gold Hand; entered a pact with “Queen Mother, goddess of dragons” (analogous to Bahamut?)
    - Explains how she got “draconic powers” → draconic sorcerer?

Armor shop people investigate the warp armor fragment left behind

- Gilded stone done to insulate magically?
    - Rene identify → some kind of arcane battery
- Offer to augment stuff if we bring them at least 50 scales
- Meth and Erris leave behind clothes to enchant (5 days); Lio wears studded armor which would take a month
    - Armor will be done by “16th of Elturiac”
    - We come back in 5 days

As we leave the shop, we notice a face-tattooed man with a turban (recognized as Thayan)

- Wearing green robes
- Erris attempts Hold Person and fails
- He attacks → “you know what to do. Nice and clean.”
- Meth stuns the guy → loses control of the other people
- “Finally. My mind returns” — Thayan Archmage
    - He absorbs some assassin’s life essence
- We heal the guy to get him back up to replay his flute
    - “Goodbye (Ernmayhas??). You and your brother will never see the light of day again”
    - They fail WIS saves and fall down dead
- Stasyevjo
    - Allegedly some refugee; Jaarmath recognized him
- We decide to teleport to Darkhold to save travel time → Erris doesn’t remember the inn name, but Rima does: Thieves’ Drop
- We teleport successfully!
    - Trading post has been shuttered close
    - This was supposed to be a permanent crossing into Eastern Faerun, but has been abandoned
- Investigating Darkhold:
    - Last day a customer was logged: 3rd of Nidal, 1239 (~40 days ago)
    - 3 different travelers that night:
        - Elven lady with facial scars; mole on her chin
        - Young man, some kind of author travelling for inspiration for his book
        - Suspicious man with oily long black hair, wore dark heavy coat, older
    - Trading post empty; all money + letters taken
    - Levia sees some glinting down the cliff → notices brittle shattered jewelry
- Erris tells the party about his downtime adventure
    - Nali recognizes Sememmon (guy Erris/Rima freed) as a leader of the criminal gang Cobalt Reavers
        - Her Sememmon was affiliated with the Golden Hand + Tryptarch
- Lio notices Zhents coming from the castle; we set up an ambush
    
    - Namman: black-haired elf, seems relatively conscientious
    - Kell and Eriti are humans
