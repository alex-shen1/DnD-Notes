Ethan recap → “Interesting Inspiration” — reroll any single ability check once across party

Everyone has been staying in town except Meth; wake up on the 15th

Game master **Mr. Jaff** greets us in the morning, offers us breakfast HOWEVER since Meth isn’t there we can’t learn the trials and will be disqualified unless Meth arrives by 10 → but he does

Instead, he gives us the rules himself:

- 2 events!
- “Endure the pain” → pick one member to get beat up, last 10 standing will have their groups go through
    - No healing/transformation allowed until end of event
- Double battles
    - Groups of 2, one substitute
    - Teams with 4 wins move on; top 5 move on to finals

## Ambush

They’ve been having “security issues” → purple tiefling stole food

Sus guard responds to hearing the name “Rene” and attacks us

“It’s so funny that I’d run into you here”

Something dramatic (good? bad?) is also happening above us in the colosseum, screams

His name is **Fohifrora** (definitely human), but he says it’s not important because we’re too late

Looks at Rene and says “See you soon.” as Meth kills him

  

All the other teams dead in the dining hall!

We bash our way through an obstruction

Hoid, covered in blood, with Nali (purple tiefling) and 5 members of One Punch

  

Fohifrora shows up again but doesn’t seem to recognize us

Nali is missing both arms now

Meteor impact in the stands, hundreds dead!?

Fohifrora refers to Sy as “lord”

Fohifrora says “You need to kill the bird” (??)

Members appear to be imposters/shapechanged
