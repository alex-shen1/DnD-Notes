## Return to Evereska

- Notice guards missing from the TriKlasthe
- Lio flies up and sees guards rushing towards the Mage’s Quarter
    - “City is on lockdown”
    - Guard says we can meet with “his queen” (Extol, not the Hunt/Partition)

### Team splits up

**Erris and Meth run towards the Mage’s Quarter**

- Erris attempts to lift Meth but he (and gear) is over 400 lbs
- Erris flies over, Meth just LEAPS over the 40ft wall and takes no damage
- We see a moving sculpture of 6 fused metal rings
    - Image of Champion of the 3rd queen
- Run into Lion guards (Extol) who demand we stop and go with them
    - Brought into a safe room with ~100 civilians
- Meth has been singing to a baby for 30 minutes
    - Actually got it to stop crying!
- We get bailed out by Levia and Rene

**Lio goes off to scan the city with Locate Creature**

- Doesn’t find Innil
- Sees 30 guards in the (Kaal estate?)

**Levia and Rene are left with Hoid and Golos to enter the TriKlasthe**

- Meet Queen of Extol who is doing paperwork to tell them about Innil
- “My other does not make mistakes”
- Queen is declaring martial law, rearming the city
- Innil escaped, “might have died” 🤔
- Trial area is blown up
- Letter from Queen of Hunt, possibly missing guards near Runes of Rhest
- Given a pass to investigate the city

### We go to the Mage’s Quarter to investigate

- Rene rolls terribly and we take 20 minutes lmao
- Destroyed decorations, puddles of blood, building destroyed, Lion guard already there
    - Halar Starshatter’s quarters are on fire
- Shady bishops from the tavern are there!
    - Some other guy with “pauldrons with a spider made out of bones”
    - Most of em are healing
- Professor tells Erris that Rima was killed, her body taken with them
    - Killed by Innil who then firebombed the academy
- We see a guy on the floor (_Messin Ned_)
    - Triam was stabbed and taken through the portal
    - Guru Grell — recruits Rene to heal, they begin to talk
        - He was attacked by a short warpriest
        - They took 2 professors
        - Grell runs the Temple of Oghma, which is open to everybody
        - Theseus was killed
        - Target was probably the Weave Barrier component in the Mage’s Quarter
        - Weave Barrier blocks teleportation from outside - must’ve come in from inside

## (Hob)Goblin Interrogation

- Lots of goblins, hobgoblins, bugbears imprisoned in a wooden cage
- Erris charms most of them, but they don’t speak Common
- Only one goblin seems to be able to speak; part of ear has been chopped off
- Interrogation efforts largely ineffective
- Levia teleports in, triggering...

### Cage Fight

- Meth stomps through the roof of the cage, suspended upside down
- Levia gets BODIED
- Goons attempt to escape carrying the presumably-leader goblin, don’t succeed
- We directly aided and abetted police brutality

### Interrogation, for real

- Meth returns with his bucket and throws it at the guy
- “They kept saying bubble”
- Meth (batman voice): _**”mark it on the map”**_
- Red Hand smuggled themselves into the city via the river
- “Pocket portal thing” to get ogres in
- Attacking some place called Terrelton?
    - Triltongue/mouth?
    - Building up a secret force from the west
- Led by some war priest (Hugenex?)
    - He works for Sarvith the Wyrmlord
- Hostages
    - Girl, boy, old elves, young people (~10 total)
    - Went with Innil
    - Going to be sacrificed soon
    - Help with the “secret weapon” to the west
- They allegedly burned down his clan house 50 years ago
    - Some elf did it

### Aftermath

- We get 10 reviving diamonds (RIP most of our Rahsta)
- Guard gives us some info
- Lio attempts to force memory recall to predict where Innil is going
