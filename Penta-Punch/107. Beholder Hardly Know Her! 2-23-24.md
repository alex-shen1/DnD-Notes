Ethan recap

**Palter Exploration Inspiration**: each member has advantage on first Arcana

  

Whole room is rotated — door is 10 ft up

Grandad notices that we’re standing on a huge door frozen over, directly above us is another huge door

- The doors on the walls are humanoid-shaped, but these are not

Meth and Erris go up to check out the closest door → completely frozen over

- Erris blasts with Fire Bolt to melt the ice; Meth and Granddad pull open the door
- Nothing behind the door except ice — looks like anything on that side were sheared off in the crash

We resolve to check the other side — other side is 50ft up

- Granddad needs to Acrobatics his way up by wall jumping
- This one also sheared off

Son thinks to check doors that look like they have cracks in them

They collapse the crevasse when trying to open the door, but we Wind Walk through it

Around 300 ft in, encounter a remorhaz tunnel

Choose to simply continue, find another upside-down room

![[Untitled 52.png|Untitled 52.png]]

Looks like a shrine of some sort, face of statue has been ripped off

- Letza points out this is odd, because the Palterians didn’t worship any gods
- DC 30 religion check — we have no idea who this is

Long rest

Find a “Palterian hallway” — door with dead end; right-hand wall has (prison-esque) bars, left has iron circular iron door with handprint in the middle

- Looks like a vault designed to lock things in
- Erris places hand on the door — stuck to the door, deduces that something _inside_ the vault is powering
    - I can pulse my own magic into the door to deactivate it
    - Erris narrowly fails; Grandad just rips the door off the wall lol

Go in → get shot by “manastone” turret (same material that nullified magic)

- Defeat it by tossing coins to bait out shots + Son uses Sharpshooter

Pressure plate traps → Erris is floating

We find the center of the vault

Brass coils converting magical energy of item inside to whatever’s in it

“Arcane battery” covered in frost, charged by item floating inside brass cage

Find some “broken dome”? Most of party gets scuffed up by the climb

Enter this room, very high ceilings:

![[Untitled 3 11.png|Untitled 3 11.png]]

Big mural on the floor, no flames

- Man plunging hand into a woman’s chest; woman’s face is not in pain
- “Any movement and the ceiling could come down on us” -Grandad
- Groaning sound happens (same as when abberations showed up), room starts shaking
- Ceiling looks like it’ll cave in
    - Movement challenge: everyone needs to get to the other side in one round

  

Next event:

- See some remorhaz
- DEEP hole in the ground, we go down and land on an iceberg
    
    - Find bangle, has enchantment magic
    - Floating eye talks to us (we’re touching his treasure?)
        
        - “Sweet smell” — fresh magic

    > Xorannox creates three of the following psionic eye effects. Unless otherwise stated, each eye targets a creature who he can see within 120 feet of him. He can’t use the same effect twice on a turn.
    > 
    > 1. Charm Beam. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by Xorannox for 1 hour, or until he harms the creature or one of their allies.
    > 
    > 2. Compulsion Beam. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw or use their reaction, if available, to move up to their speed toward the closest ally they can see and make one weapon attack against them. Creatures who can’t be charmed are unaffected.
    > 
    > 3. Memory Beam. The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, if the creature has unexpended spell slots, they expend a spell slot of their highest remaining level, with no effect. If they don’t have unexpended spell slots, they instead lose proficiency with a weapon they’re holding or carrying for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn).
    > 
    > 4. Toxic Vapors. Xorannox chooses a point he can see within 120 feet of him. Each creature within 10 feet of the point must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn).
    > 
    > 5. Telekinetic Field. Xorannox chooses a point he can see within 120 feet of him. Each enemy within 10 feet of the point must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be moved up to 30 feet in any direction and take 7 (2d6) force damage at the end of the move. Additionally, Xorannox can target any object within 10 feet of the point that weighs 300 pounds or less and isn’t being worn or carried, moving it up to 30 feet in any direction. Xorannox can also exert fine control on objects with this effect, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.
    > 
    > 6. Lightning Bolt. Xorannox shoots a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line of lightning. Each creature in the line must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
    > 
    > 7. Explosion. Xorannox chooses a point he can see within 120 feet of him. Each creature within 10 feet of the point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
    > 
    > 8. Necrosis Beam. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or immediately take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage and lose 7 (2d6) hit points at the start of each of their turns. If this effect reduces a target’s hit points to 0, they die. The effect ends if Xorannox dies or can’t see the target. This psionic effect can’t be used again while this effect persists.
    

Bro has a MEGABEAM

- Almost instakills Letza but Granddad has a CLUTCH damage reduction
- He uses a “Palterian Crown” and vanishes
