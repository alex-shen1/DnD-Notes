We decide to go east, towards nearest mountain following goat instructions

Tiamat is a “minor goddess of trickery, starvation, and maternity” in Nali’s world

We notice a rock structure along the way

- 5 ft monolith, concave top
- Erris and Rene → recognize Primordial text scraped into the text
- Rene recognizes this as a guide post; knows Primordial so reads it
    - “Here lies Rusil the Inhaler”
        - Wood elf name, old fashioned?
        - “Akin to someone named Archibald, or even older”
- While Rene reads, Erris casts Detect Magic
    - Detects a “leyline” connecting this marker to another one
    - Pointing kinda the way we came, but further southward
- Rene realizes that the indentation is designed for a chin → looking in the direction the leyline points is more hills
- Levia recognizes an “evil material” fungus thing like what was on the goat
    - Lio: purply/reddish fungus not found outside of the underdark
    - Feels weirdly fleshy, cold
    - The fungus is kinda like glue? Holding the stuff together
- Fungus seems to absorb magic
    - Absorbs Prestidigitation; explodes when hit with Fire Bolt though

Keep going through to find the next ley lines!

Skill challenge

Lio promises to build a garden to make horse food

Success!

3 days and 400+ cairns

We’re getting near the Orsruun Mountains

We realize the cairns have been arranged in a cycloneish pattern (not a spiral)

Decide to go towards the center

As we move towards → something “primordially powerful” in the general area

Tigre is unsettled by the “tumors” on the trees

  

We stealth and see a treant!

![[Untitled 46.png|Untitled 46.png]]

Arm covered in fungus; plunged it into another tree and removed fungus

- Unclear whether or not it’s deliberately infecting or
- Arcana roll:
    - “Generally chaotic creatures” not evil or good;
    - Usually found around intense nature magic
    - Fey magic brought it to life;
    - The material itself seems alive; druids would consider it against nature
    - They speak Druidic, Sylvan, Elvish, and other fey-based languages
- Investigate the stab hole as we walk by
    
    - “Fungus” is feeding on the nature magic that is growing the trees
    
      
    
- Treant asks us “who dares come to the vault”; Tigre says “hushpuppies”
- Treant recognizes that we know Hoid
- “Has he abandoned you to face me alone after all these years?”
- “He left us here. He made this happen. Any friend of Hoid is an enemy of mine”
- Main baddie: “Wraithroot tree”

  

Entryway into fungal material that “looks like puckered butthole” starts closing → we all run into it

We land into dungeon - entire walls are this fleshy mucus
