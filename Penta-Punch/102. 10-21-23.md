Small bit of growth on my boots when I casted Heal → easily removed

Rene places a piece of the flesh into lead box → killed it

- The “flesh” isn’t actually flesh but some kind of arcane construct

“Fungal mouth” blocking our path → very obviously a set of lips/teeth/tongue

- Meth pokes the tongue and it wriggles
- Levia wrips some flesh off the ground and places it on the tongue
    - Mouth immediately sucks it in and starts chewing; bone cracking sounds
    - Spits it out → material has been turned into acid
- Luna summoned to scout → this is a terrible idea because the dungeon wants to consume magic
- Erris conjures a “trinket” with Prestidigitation
    - Immediately spat out again
- Rene offers the Pipe of the Sewers lul
    - Mouth expands beyond its size
    - Mouth opens!

Levia opens a door and gets bitten by a mimic

- Fire bolt reduced to half by fleshy material
    - Psychic is also halfed
- Mimics distantly related to ochre jellies; definitely have mental processes
- Rene self-casts invisibility → half movement as flesh grabs at her

More random trees throughout the dungeon → unclear if it’s because this place was dedicated to nature deity or just growth since it was abandoned

Random piece of paper in the roots of the tree → Rene attempts to read it and most of it rips off, but here

![[Untitled 47.png|Untitled 47.png]]

- Name “Amnit” gets nothing on a History, but roll Religion:
    - “Abject Pain” invokes Ilmater, the Crying God/The One Who Endured
    - This was once a shrine to Verenestra
        - …this was just one of Hoid’s notes

We see a pan in the wall?

- Levia pulls it out, it looks like a pan but has spikes in the side
- See other place that look like kitchen → fleshy material has replaced the original layout
- Erris attempts to scrape the fleshy wall → underneath is more layers of flesh; after digging a few inches there’s a stone surface
- But it heals immediately after pulling blade away

Rene went back to check a tree, found another note:

- But also gets attacked by a treant
- New note: different type of paper

Spell slots cause wild magic surge 🙂

Floor is covered in teeth - touching reveals that it’s just the same material

We encounter a pool of red liquid, depth unclear

- Throw copper coin with Light → snuffed out after 5 ft

Flesh in Rene’s lead box turned into some weird liquid

- Color of the liquid “reminds you of color mixing” (?)
- Pouring it onto the ground bubbles back into flesh material

Exposure to the red liquid permanently damages magic items

- Rene loses resistance to poison from her armor temporarily and permanently loses 2 STR from her gauntlets 😕
- Nali and Erris are COOKING with Fire Bolts

New note in Hoid’s treasure cache:

![[Untitled 4 4.png|Untitled 4 4.png]]

- Draconia is home of dragons; Vaasa

DOUBLE NAT 20

Another note:

![[Untitled 5 3.png|Untitled 5 3.png]]

A voice says: “welcome to my lair.”

Same guy as before:

![[Untitled 6 3.png|Untitled 6 3.png]]

- “Friends of Hoid. Welcome”
- Wants us to bring Hoid to him, angry at him
- Teeth are comprised of magic items → maybe it’s a sentient collection of magic items?
- Directed at us:
    - Meth: choose between found family, or true family?
    - Erris: save the one you love right now - victory or life beyond adventuring?
    - Levia: Look into mirror alone; kill mentor or redeem?
- One will die before adventure is over
- “Connection with brothers” allows to see all
- Absolve the tracker — shows us teleportation runes
- In pain, never meant to be alive

“I was never meant to be born” → we can fix that for you!

- Combat 🙂

The Real Baddie arrives:

![[Untitled 7 3.png|Untitled 7 3.png]]

Sibriex (abyssal-like entity constructed from sentient items)

Erris gets ALL SP back and JUICES a double heal

Telekinesis COOKING

Nali gets Feebleminded

Final words: “You all….you’ll wish you had trusted me”

Erris finds a pristine bone/muscle blade — **Dagger of Everstrength**

- When stabbed into the user, buffs a stat up to 20 but also reduces HP by 20 permanently
- Can change stat on a long rest, but remove lose stat and HP loss

Meth retrieves **Amulet of the Planes** (”hockey puck with teleport runes on”)

- One time teleport to one location with 8 creatures, cannot learn it
- Not made by Hoid; made by the sibriex in response to what we might want in the future
- Rene knows: it will teleport us to Draconia

  

Fly down the hole, mouth says “beware of **Calabrizax”**

  

Conclusion from the notes: the priest guy has the “absolve” rune that will break the tracking on Nali; we need to go to Draconia with the amulet to get there

aaand this shows up
