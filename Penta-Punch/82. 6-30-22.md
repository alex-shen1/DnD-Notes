## Traveling

- Open the session planning travel into the Thornwaste
- Meth realizes the summoned devils asked _him_ if he summoned them
    - They thought he was Azarr Kul
    - Erris realizes Azarr Kul’s cloak was magical
- Rene summons a pegasus names it Bolt
    - Bolt has a NJ accent
- We fly above a Red Hand patrol but they don’t notice us

## The Thornwaste

![[Untitled 28.png|Untitled 28.png]]

- Wassup wassup wassup….commune connect
    - We ask questions while communing with Oghma:
        - Is the Ghostlord’s lair underground: unclear
        - Is it hidden with magic: yes
        - Can the Ghostlord be negotiated with: yes
    - Oghma is pleased with Rene’s performance, also tells us “Watch out.”
- Levia uses Divine Sense; points us southeast
- Ant no longer blinks

We stop at a plateau

- Rene and Levia unsuccessfully investigate south side, there’s a river
- Ant and Erris look down the northern portion - a lot less water, easily 100 ft down
- Meth investigates the eastern side, sees a lizard (”Oh shit! A snake!”)

## Combat!

- Varanthian, Disciple of the Serpent of the Sands
    - Behir, 17 AC
- We kill him, but get approached by more Red Hand orcs
- Defeat them with only 1 left
    - We get a scroll of random summoning
- Interrogation
    - “Talos will burn you with his lightning!”
    - “Talos destroyed the Serpent of the Sands” → “Hi, my name’s Talos” -Levia
    - Meth kills him as he tries to break free and transform into a warthog (?)
- Erris investigation: Leader has a medallion for Talos (greater deity of storms and destruction)
    - Keeps it :)

## Short Rest

- Rene realizes that maybe it’s a labyrinth
- We finally arrive, following the river upstream
    - Ruins of some town, hidden from above (reminds Levia/Rene of Evereska)
    - Illusion is being produced by a 100x100x60 ziggurat
- Camp in front of the ziggurat
    - 4 tents in a circular fashion, 2 people at the campfire
    - The pyramid itself is an illusion?
