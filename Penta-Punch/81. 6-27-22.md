Similar to Meth 🤔

  

Rene starts writing a Rune of Grehik on paper

Meth jumps 100+ ft into the air, misses, and then takes all that fall damage

Rene successfully banishes Tyrgarun to the Deep Ethereal (reminds Erris of black orbs)

- The atropal heart cracks with the sacrifice
- Stone causes Rene to forget about its existence

Rest of the day spent traveling north through the Witchweald with no encounters

## Dawn of the 30th
