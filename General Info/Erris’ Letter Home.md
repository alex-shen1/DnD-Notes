**From: Erris**

  

Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.

I hope this letter finds you well. Or at all, really. How long has it been, **10 years**? Ever since I left home, I’ve been firing these letters off into the abyss, not knowing whether or not the blasted courier will find its way to you. And even, if by some miracle, my letters reached Thay, it’d be completely unreasonable to expect you to be able to scrape together enough coin to pay for a reply. Well, that ends today.

You see, I’ve come a long way from being a frightened refugee, fleeing the tyranny of the Red Wizards. While being smuggled out of Thay by that merchant caravan, I furthered my practice of magic and figured out I had a knack for it. I spent a few years traveling around the Sword Coast with the caravan, doing odd jobs as you might expect of a youth. Upon noticing my interest in magic, one of the more well-traveled merchants recommended that I formally pursue its study at Candlekeep, the city of scholars. The keep itself is truly magnificent; I wish I could show it to you some day. After some trials and tribulations, I secured an apprenticeship with an archivist at the Great Library, but unfortunately the life of an academic is not for me. Just like it was for me at the start, to this day magic just _happens_ for me. The only really good thing I have to show for my time at Candlekeep is my delightful feline familiar, Luna. I’ll be honest, there were definitely more _useful_ spells I could have learned while I was there, but her companionship at the loneliest times has been worth more to me than any powerful magic.

Accordingly, after years of largely futile study, I left to make my own way in the world. There were a few false starts, and at one point I was even ambushed and left for dead in the Anauroch Desert, but I think I’ve finally found a reliable adventuring party. We call ourselves Penta-Punch, and we recently just saved the city of Talar from a invasion from an dragon-led organization that called itself the Red Hand. As the most capable fighters in the region, we acted as a standalone guerilla strike force that crippled key components of the Red Hand before they even made it to the gates of Talar. All that’s not to mention our heroic efforts during the siege itself, during which (and don’t freak out!) I actually died for a short while before being resurrected. Along the way, we’ve tangled with all kinds of enemies: undead (including a centuries-old lich), dragons, goblin hordes, demons, and other infernal creatures. I don’t want to brag, but despite abandoning my studies, your son has become quite an accomplished spellcaster!

With the Red Hand crisis resolved, we’re all taking a break from adventuring together for now. The others have gone off on their own travels, while I’ve stayed in Talar at the home the city granted to us. I spend most of my days these days relaxing now, waiting for the next adventure. I’m seeing this girl, Rima, who’s actually traveling with me to deliver this letter to a courier service. I’m sure you guys would like her — she’s way better with all the academic stuff than I ever could be.

  

All of this is to say, being a successful adventurer has provided me with quite a substantial income. Assuming that nobody opens it along the way, which I suppose is absolutely not guaranteed, enclosed in the package you should find **five platinum pieces**. I apologize that it couldn’t be more; I don’t trust the courier enough to risk losing any more than that in one package. Even so, the coin should be more than enough to cover all of your expenses for quite a while. Maybe Dad can finally hire some other people to fix the barn roof, instead of making his family do it? My one wish is that, however you spend it, that you save enough to send a letter back to me. If you can find a courier that knows how to get to Talar, just tell them to deliver to the house belonging to Penta-Punch.

  

With love,

Your son

OOC notes:

- The parents’ names have been changed from what was in the original character background to something more appropriate (i.e. some stuff I grabbed out of a Thayan name generator lol) but it’s never come up before so eh
- Erris is an only child as far as he knows, but it could be interesting if there was a younger sibling conceived after he left?
- Not sure if 10 years is an appropriate amount of time to have passed? The more time, the more interesting the sibling angle could be (you can’t exactly meaningfully interact with a 9 month old sibling), but I’m not sure how to explain what he was up to during all that time except “traveling/studying” because PP is supposed to be pretty early on in his adventuring career
    - Corollary, how early do the Red Wizards start kidnapping kids?
- Not sure how much money would be appropriate to send
- I picked Nethentir because it’s a smaller eastern-ish town in Thay that still has _some_ commercial i.e. traveling merchant activity, and because it sounds cool. Would that fit?
