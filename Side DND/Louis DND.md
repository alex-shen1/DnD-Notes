In some forest, clearing w/ baby deer

Scare the deer off to prevent Imfora from hunting

Something charges at us — not fiend, celestial, or undead

“Predatory” energy thing

  

We see smoke in the distance, hear festive music

Small “town” of 4 shacks

**Milkthistle** — short pale elven woman; young

Harvest festival

Food comes from fae

  

**Grimsby Coldbottle** — middle-aged halfling

- Gives Imfora a tiny wooden clog
- In love with her after she demonstrates her strength prowess

**Samson** — black man, 30s

- Married to Canella (?); struggled to conceive sold their rings for a baby
- One of few who didn’t give his name away
- Kid **Theo**

  

Ol calms Theo

Wake up hearing argument in the night

Canella wants to take him to the city

  

Window opens in the night, Ol D. ignores it

Morning Theo is gone, attacked by magic light cloud

It’s an animated, hostile Faerie Fire
