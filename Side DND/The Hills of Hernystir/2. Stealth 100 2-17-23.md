Arrive at Torn/norT, meet NPC named **Brynmor** (other neighbors **Elgar** and **Grufudd**)

Party carries Stultus into Brynmor’s bedroom

They were gonna go east to meet up with their family today, but bandits stole carts filled with their valuables

  

Unus proposes that we use poison on the bandits, sneak into the camp

  

Stultus and Guy: looking for plants

Kaitlynne and Unus: scouting for the bandit camp

Sand and Uva: disguising Uva as Bob

  

We find berries that cause nausea

Uva immediately fucks up the plan — “Bob here to come poison you! I’m Bob!”

  

We win despite overwhelming odds, in part due to Stultus using enemies as shields

We recover the carts and horses; 2 horses are injured with bite marks

  

Other guy left the camp a few days ago, going north, brought a few guys and dogs
