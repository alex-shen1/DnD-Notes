![[Untitled 60.png|Untitled 60.png]]

Guard asks us business, Tristam explains we’re here to trade

Only 1 inn: the Eastern Stag

Unus: “What are the vagrancy laws here?”

  

Kaitlynne spots “sus” people

Unus starts an argument with the barkeep/owner

Unus, Uva, Stultus sleeping outside

  

Stultus looks for food but fails — potentially sus because land _should_ have food

  

Unus invites stable boys to marble game, Stultus is CRACKED so we name the game after him

  

Wake up to a guy screaming “Falshire has burned!” → Unus: “Who asked?”

300 dead

Wool merchants guild uprising failed

King Elias ordered the seizing of the wool merchants’ sheep to feed the capital; caused backlash

Tristam’s wife was in Falshire

  

Local job board offers bounty for wolf bandanas

Nad Mallach ruled by **Count Eolair**

Enemies in the **Stagwood** to the south

  

We meet with the Count, he tells us to talk to a guy who sends us on a mission to liberate some grain supplies

Skill challenge to retrieve; we do a great job

  

Sent to retrieve medical supplies from this old lady who fancies Tristram

Taegan

  

Turns out the “troll cum” is a common healing potion

  

We got hunting for wolves/other animals

Set a trap with hunting traps around an abandoned campfire

Some guy walks into there — turns out it’s Halcym

  

Unus declares himself protector of the woods, attacks Halcym

Uva prepares action, killing one with a nat 20 crit when he moves terrified

Halcym recognizes Stultus as having taken Aaron’s sword

We agree to follow them to the camp
