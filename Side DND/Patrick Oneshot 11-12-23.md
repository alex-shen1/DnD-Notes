We can graduate with a remedial summer class taught by Tav

  

Kat pays off Rich to be homophobic

Kat is King James Onlyist

Rich can only bring along John 1 and John 3 for the trip

What to bring?

  

Rich attempts to rizz up Kat

Dean Tav is decapitated?? Head ripped off (not cut) — possibly animal, but not sure

  

We lose most of our shit

Find a mansion and church

  

Get attacked by stuff?

  

Get attacked by Sahaguins (? fish people)

Something about stopping a ritual, go towards “creepy” house

- Labelled with “B____S. Es__at_” → later figure out **Bezos Estate**

  

Rich succeeds a persuasion check to convince the party he’s religious → Kat kisses him on the cheek

Keep going down hallway, no apparent end

Open a door to find an office

  

We find floorplans for the building, including a submarine bay??

Rich finds cursive notes on some creature called “Mammon”; this is the office of someone named Bezos

- Mammon is demon god of avarice/greed; Bezos believed it was an alien entity that helped humanoids construct pyramids to hoard wealth
- When offerings diminish, Mammon destroys the civilization
- Speculation that it’s an alien race greedier than humans

Also find stacks of papers/newspaper clippings indicating rise of Amazon, eyes crossed out
